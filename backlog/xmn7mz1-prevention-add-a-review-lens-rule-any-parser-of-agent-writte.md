# Prevention — Add a review-lens rule: any parser of agent-written files must have a negative test for each reje… (from web-everything/web-everything#5187 review)

Filed mechanically ON APPROVAL (operator rule, 2026-09-27 — "prevention outstanding should be filed by default on approval") — this accept verdict named the guard(s) below as owed. None of them blocked the approval; the debt is tracked here instead:
1. `we:scripts/operations/deliver-item-wrapper.mjs:770` — Add a review-lens rule: any parser of agent-written files must have a negative test for each rejection branch. A cheaper gate is a coverage threshold on the throw branches of the drop parser.

Already tracked on open cards (recorded there as "Also raised by", not refiled): finding 1 → #6101.

Idempotency key (do not edit): approval-prevention-key:web-everything/web-everything#5187@ec6b37eddfda49643642af1c8a4ba4b5fe1390db

## Acceptance

- [A1] **Executable** — TODO: a command that fails before this item lands and passes after.

Hint: a card that loosens a refusal needs two Must lines — what happens on error (refuse), and every input kind besides source code (docs, config, data) that the loosening must still treat cautiously.

Hint: For any receive or write endpoint, specify the body-size cap, rate limit, CSRF/origin check, and protection against abuse of state-resetting triggers; mirror each in the port test plan, or explain why it does not apply.

## Non-goals

- [N1] TODO: what this item deliberately does not do — or `n/a: <why>` when nothing is excluded.

## Edge cases this change must handle
