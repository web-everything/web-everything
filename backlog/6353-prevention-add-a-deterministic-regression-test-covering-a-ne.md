# Prevention — Add a deterministic regression test covering a near-budget existing record with an omitted review… (from web-everything/web-everything#5448 review)

Filed mechanically ON APPROVAL (operator rule, 2026-09-27 — "prevention outstanding should be filed by default on approval") — this accept verdict named the guard(s) below as owed. None of them blocked the approval; the debt is tracked here instead:

1. `we:scripts/operations/review-pr-io.mjs:1169` — Add a deterministic regression test covering a near-budget existing record with an omitted reviewer answer, asserting that subsequent auto-policy planning cannot emit a block.

Idempotency key (do not edit): approval-prevention-key:web-everything/web-everything#5448@659bfb4f09b5f0566aa15e66bb27dce916ec0481

## Acceptance

- [A1] **Executable** — TODO: a command that fails before this item lands and passes after.

Hint: a card that loosens a refusal needs two Must lines — what happens on error (refuse), and every input kind besides source code (docs, config, data) that the loosening must still treat cautiously.

Hint: For any receive or write endpoint, specify the body-size cap, rate limit, CSRF/origin check, and protection against abuse of state-resetting triggers; mirror each in the port test plan, or explain why it does not apply.

## Non-goals

- [N1] TODO: what this item deliberately does not do — or `n/a: <why>` when nothing is excluded.

## Edge cases this change must handle

One line per class: either the handling, or `n/a: <why>`.
