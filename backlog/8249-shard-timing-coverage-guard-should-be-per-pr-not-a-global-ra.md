# Shard timing-coverage guard should be per-PR, not a global ratio

PR #6774 failed in the merge queue on shard-files timing ratio 0.799 < 0.8 (2026-11-13 23:24 ET): main-wide drift from new soak breaks without timings lets any PR trip a global ratio. Make the guard per-PR: new break files need a timing.

## Acceptance

- [A1] **Executable** — TODO: a command that fails before this item lands and passes after.

Hint: a card that loosens a refusal needs two Must lines — what happens on error (refuse), and every input kind besides source code (docs, config, data) that the loosening must still treat cautiously.

Hint: For any receive or write endpoint, specify the body-size cap, rate limit, CSRF/origin check, and protection against abuse of state-resetting triggers; mirror each in the port test plan, or explain why it does not apply.

## Non-goals

- [N1] TODO: what this item deliberately does not do — or `n/a: <why>` when nothing is excluded.

## Edge cases this change must handle

One line per class: either the handling, or `n/a: <why>`.

1. **Untrusted text** — TODO: the handling, or n/a: <why>.
2. **Truncated reads** — TODO: the handling, or n/a: <why>.
3. **Shared state files** — TODO: the handling, or n/a: <why>.
4. **Fail closed** — TODO: the handling, or n/a: <why>.
5. **Identity scoping** — TODO: the handling, or n/a: <why>.
6. **State over time** — TODO: the handling, or n/a: <why>.
7. **Who wrote it** — TODO: the handling, or n/a: <why>.

## Duplicate admission

Checked with capability-search and a backlog scan on 2026-11-14; no open card covers this exact change.
