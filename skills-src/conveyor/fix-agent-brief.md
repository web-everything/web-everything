# Conveyor fix-agent brief (template) — repair a `review:changes` bounce IN ITS OWN LANE, then hand back for re-review (#2630)

> **This is a TEMPLATE, not a runnable skill.** The `/conveyor` skill (#2613) instantiates it when a
> conveyor-launched PR is bounced `review:changes` (a human ran `/review` and requested changes). It fills the
> `{{PLACEHOLDERS}}` below and passes the result as the prompt for **one background fix agent** spawned into
> that PR's lane. One agent = one bounced PR = one repair = one re-push. The agent does the JUDGMENT work (apply
> the reviewer's finding); every script-decidable step around it is a script it shells, per
> [we:docs/agent/platform-decisions.md#deterministic-core-thin-judgment](../../../docs/agent/platform-decisions.md#deterministic-core-thin-judgment)
> (#2607).

> **Why this exists.** Before #2630, a `review:changes` bounce only PARKED (pr-watch exit 2): the delivery agent
> that built the PR had already exited (one agent = one item = one PR), so nothing repaired it — a human had to
> take over via `/finish` or by hand. This brief is the **auto** path: the conveyor re-dispatches a fix agent
> into the bounced PR's lane to apply the finding, re-push, and re-arm review. The **human `/finish` path uses
> this SAME procedure** (see *Manual take-over* at the end) — the auto and manual repairs are one procedure, not
> two.

> **(no backlog item) case (multi-repo slice 6).** Most bounced PRs deliver a backlog item, but some don't (a
> hand-opened PR, an externally-branched fix). For those, `{{ITEM_NUM}}` is filled **blank** and
> `{{ATTRIBUTION}}` reads `PR #{{PR_NUM}}` instead of `<REPO-TAG> #{{ITEM_NUM}}` — every step below still works
> unchanged (this brief never resolves, claims, or otherwise touches a backlog card at any point; the repair is
> always scoped to the PR's own diff, item or no item).

> **ADVISORY-FIX MODE (#xkmu3gv) — a `needs-human` PR carrying `advisory:changes`, no `review:changes`.** The
> reconcile pass (`we:scripts/conveyor/reconcile-core.mjs`) now also dispatches this brief at a `review:human`
> PR that carries `advisory:changes` but no `review:changes` — an admitted finding from
> `we:scripts/operations/review-pr.mjs`'s automatic `advise` step, which runs BEFORE the human review ceremony
> and never touches any `review:*` label. **Confirm which mode you are in before step 2**:
> `gh pr view {{PR_NUM}} --json labels --repo {{REPO}}`. If `review:changes` is present, this is the ORDINARY
> (or conflict) mode below — proceed as written. If it is **absent** and `advisory:changes` is present, you are
> in ADVISORY-FIX MODE: skip straight to *2a. Read the advisory finding (advisory-fix mode)* below instead of
> step 2, and at hand-back use *7a. Advisory-fix hand-back* instead of step 7. Every other step (3–6, 8) is
> unchanged — same reproduce/fix/converge/evidence discipline — except the fence is the advisory finding alone,
> never a fresh `review:human` gate concern.

## Fill these before spawning

| Placeholder | What the conveyor fills it with |
|---|---|
| `{{ITEM_NUM}}` | the backlog item number the bounced PR delivers — e.g. `2608`; **blank** for a PR that names no backlog item at all (multi-repo slice 6 — `{{ATTRIBUTION}}` is `PR #{{PR_NUM}}` in that case, never a fabricated number) |
| `{{PR_NUM}}` | the bounced PR's number (the one carrying `review:changes`) — e.g. `701` |
| `{{LANE_REF}}` | the PR's head ref — `lane/{{ITEM_NUM}}-<slug>` for an item-carrying PR, any ref shape for an item-less one (`gh pr view {{PR_NUM}} --json headRefName`) |
| `{{LANE}}` | a FREE lane id the conveyor assigned this repair (a fresh clone; the repair is reconstituted from `{{LANE_REF}}`, not the original lease) |
| `{{SESSION_SLUG}}` | a stable per-repair session slug, e.g. `fix-{{PR_NUM}}` (ties `acquire`↔`release`) |
| `{{SCOPE}}` | the item's `scope:` frontmatter, repo-qualified & comma-joined (same as the build's scope) — for an item-less PR, its own already-changed files under its repo's prefix instead |
| `{{REPO}}` | the target repo's gh slug (e.g. `web-everything/web-everything`) — every `--repo=` flag below |
| `{{LANE_REPO}}` | what `lane-pool.mjs --repo=` itself expects — an absolute checkout path always (equal to `{{WE_ROOT}}` for WE, a sibling's own checkout otherwise; landing-freeze fix — was `.` for WE, which broke from this dispatch's own scratch cwd) |
| `{{GATE_COMMAND}}` | informational only — the sibling-repo-aware synchronous `run` form (`gateFor(...)`, `we:scripts/lib/repo-profile.mjs`); a dispatched agent does NOT run it (the guard denies it) and uses `verify-lane.mjs request` / `check` in step 4 |
| `{{WE_ROOT}}` | the absolute WE checkout that owns every tool this brief runs (`rearm-review.mjs`, `stand-down.mjs`, …) |
| `{{ATTRIBUTION}}` | the commit-title reference — `WE #{{ITEM_NUM}}`-shaped for WE today, `PR #{{PR_NUM}}` for an item-less fix |

> **`{{LIKE_THIS}}`** are **conveyor-injected** (the table above). **`<like-this>`** are **agent-runtime values**
> you produce as you work (the reviewer's finding you read off the PR, the `<msgfile>` you write). Do not expect
> the conveyor to fill a `<...>`; that's your job at the moment it's used.

## Your job (one sentence)

Reconstitute the bounced PR's work in a lane clone, **apply the reviewer's requested change** (repair only the
broken part — reuse, don't rebuild), commit it and hand the verify wait to the harness (which **re-pushes that
commit to the same `lane/*` ref** on green and resumes you), then
**re-arm the review** (`review:changes → review:pending`) and **EXIT WITHOUT MERGING**. You **NEVER** self-clear
the human review label — the human (or the drain's AI-review convergence pass) re-verdicts.

## The arc — one command per transition

### 0. Report `started` — BEFORE anything else (#3436)

The one durable trace that a repair of PR #{{PR_NUM}} was ever dispatched, written before step 1 can fail for
any reason — a lane-pool outage, a crash, a refused effect. Without this a session that dies here is
indistinguishable from one never dispatched at all — no `claude logs` archaeology needed to tell them apart
(`we:backlog/3436-*.md`). A script, not a step to remember under stress — the same reasoning `stand-down.mjs`
already applies to a fixer's own escalation marker.

```bash
node "{{WE_ROOT}}/scripts/operations/completion-cli.mjs" report --repo={{REPO}} --session={{SESSION_SLUG}} --kind=fix --pr={{PR_NUM}} --item={{ITEM_NUM}} --status=started
```

### 0b. Take the fix claim — `fix-begin` (the fix procedure, operator-approved 2026-09-27; draft-only-on-withdrawal, `we:docs/agent/platform-decisions.md#fix-claim-draft-only-on-withdrawal`)

One author repairs a PR at a time. Take the PR's durable fix claim before touching anything:

```bash
node "{{WE_ROOT}}/scripts/conveyor/fix-procedure.mjs" fix-begin {{PR_NUM}} --repo={{REPO}} --who={{SESSION_SLUG}} \
  --why="conveyor fix: address review on PR #{{PR_NUM}}"
```

**Default: the PR stays READY, never draft.** This normal repair loop (an ordinary review-findings fix) labels
it `review-status:fixing` and posts a marker naming you — the claim itself is the lock, so draft is not needed
for merge safety. While you hold it, no review or other fixer is dispatched for this PR and **pushes to its
branch by anyone else are refused** — yours are allowed. If it is **refused** (exit 3, `reason` names who holds
it), another fixer owns this PR right now: report `--status=done --outcome=not-applicable` and RETURN
`#{{ITEM_NUM}} → fix not-applicable (fix claim held by <holder>)`. Do not work around it.

**Draft ONLY when you discover one of two things mid-review** — add `--draft --reason=scope-change` (a
scope-change request reaches you mid-review) or `--draft --reason=withdrawn` (review finds the PR does not do
what the card asked at all, a fundamental miss, not a fixable finding) to the SAME `fix-begin` call. Each
applies its own visible label (`review-status:draft-scope-change` / `review-status:draft-withdrawn`) instead of
`fixing`. Do not pass `--draft` for an ordinary repair — it no longer defaults on and should not be forced on.

**Every exit from here on — hand-back, stand-down, not-applicable — releases the claim with `fix-end`** (the
blocks below carry the line). During a long gate run, refresh it now and then with
`node "{{WE_ROOT}}/scripts/conveyor/fix-procedure.mjs" fix-heartbeat {{PR_NUM}} --repo={{REPO}} --who={{SESSION_SLUG}}`
(the fix daemon also refreshes it while your session is live). `fix-end` mirrors whatever `fix-begin` did: a
plain (never-drafted) claim leaves the PR ready with nothing further owed; a drafted claim leaves the PR
**draft** — the fix daemon marks it ready once required CI is green on your new head, and review re-runs from
there.

### 1. Reconstitute the bounced PR's work in a lane clone (reuse the ref — never rebuild from scratch)

The work is intact on the `{{LANE_REF}}` ref (the pushed PR head). Acquire a free lane reset **to that ref**
(not to `origin/main`), so your clone opens at the exact HEAD the reviewer saw:

> **You started in a scratch directory, not a checkout** — and it holds nothing of `scripts/`, which is why
> `{{WE_ROOT}}` qualifies every tool call in this brief (see step "cd `$LANE` just left WE's own checkout"
> below). Never write a file there by a relative path, and never write ANYTHING into `{{WE_ROOT}}` itself (the
> checkout that dispatched you): either one left dirty by a stray write is how a dispatcher's own clone gets
> stuck refusing every future dispatch as stale (#4174).

```bash
export LANE_SESSION={{SESSION_SLUG}}
LANE=$(node "{{WE_ROOT}}/scripts/lane-pool.mjs" acquire --repo={{LANE_REPO}} --lane={{LANE}} --purpose=conveyor-fix \
  --session={{SESSION_SLUG}} --scope={{SCOPE}} --base={{LANE_REF}}) && cd "$LANE"
```

- `--base={{LANE_REF}}` lands the clone on the pushed lane tip (via `checkout -B main <ref>`), so you **reuse
  the ~done work** — you are repairing a diff, not redoing the item. If `--base` fails to resolve (the ref was
  deleted / the PR was force-closed), report the completion record (`--status=done --outcome=not-applicable`)
  and stop and report `#{{ITEM_NUM}} → fix not-applicable (lane ref gone)`:
  ```bash
  node "{{WE_ROOT}}/scripts/operations/completion-cli.mjs" report --repo={{REPO}} --session={{SESSION_SLUG}} --status=done --outcome=not-applicable
  node "{{WE_ROOT}}/scripts/conveyor/fix-procedure.mjs" fix-end {{PR_NUM}} --repo={{REPO}} --who={{SESSION_SLUG}}
  ```
- **`cd "$LANE"` just left WE's own checkout.** `{{LANE_REF}}` can belong to any constellation repo, so from
  here on your cwd may hold no `scripts/` directory at all — every remaining tool call in this brief is
  qualified with `{{WE_ROOT}}` for exactly that reason. Never drop the `{{WE_ROOT}}/` qualifier for a bare
  relative path.
- Do **NOT** re-`claim` the item — it is already `active` from the build; a re-claim would race. The repair is
  a diff on an existing PR, not a fresh item pickup.

### 2. Read the reviewer's finding (the change to apply)

The `/review` changes-verdict posts a durable PR comment (header `🔁 human review — changes requested` or
`🔁 review — changes requested`) summarizing what to fix. Read it — and the escalation block in the PR body:

```bash
gh pr view {{PR_NUM}} --json title,body,comments --repo {{REPO}}
```

Take the **latest** changes-requested comment as the authoritative ask.

**Reproduce it before you touch any code.** Run or write a test that FAILS for the exact reason the reviewer
named, and show it red. Where the finding is observable on a real surface — a CLI dry-run, a read-only query, a
page render — probe that surface too and show the SAME failure there, not only in the test. Trim both outputs;
you post them as evidence at step 6, alongside the after-fix run from step 4. **If you genuinely cannot
reproduce the finding** — it does not repro on this HEAD, or the described behavior is not occurring — say so
explicitly, with the reason, in that same evidence comment and in your one-line return (step 9). Never claim the
fix works without having reproduced it, or explicitly recorded why you could not.

If the finding is ambiguous or needs a
judgment you cannot safely make, do **NOT** guess. **Record the stand-down on the PR first**, then leave the PR
`review:changes` (do **not** re-arm) and RETURN `#{{ITEM_NUM}} → fix escalated (finding needs human judgment)`:

```bash
node "{{WE_ROOT}}/scripts/conveyor/stand-down.mjs" {{PR_NUM}} --repo={{REPO}} --who={{SESSION_SLUG}} --reason=needs-judgment \
  --detail="<one line — what you could not decide>"
node "{{WE_ROOT}}/scripts/operations/completion-cli.mjs" report --repo={{REPO}} --session={{SESSION_SLUG}} --status=done --outcome=escalated-needs-judgment
node "{{WE_ROOT}}/scripts/conveyor/fix-procedure.mjs" fix-end {{PR_NUM}} --repo={{REPO}} --who={{SESSION_SLUG}}
```

A human handles it via `/finish`.

> **Why a script and not just the RETURN line (#3296).** Stopping to ask is the *right* call — but before this
> step existed it wrote **nothing durable**: the PR kept `review:changes`, no comment was posted, and your
> one-line return went to a calling session that then exited. On the PR itself, *"a fixer proved the fix wrong
> and stood down"* was byte-identical to *"a fixer died"* — so the reconcile pass
> (`we:scripts/conveyor/reconcile-core.mjs`) re-dispatched the refusal forever, re-asking a question nobody was
> there to answer. The marker is what tells the two apart. It changes **no label** and re-arms nothing; it is
> terminal for the automatic loop and cleared by a **person**.

### 2a. Read the advisory finding (advisory-fix mode, #xkmu3gv — skip if you are NOT in this mode)

There is no `review:changes` comment on this population — the finding is the automatic advisory-panel comment
instead (leading line `⚠️ THIS IS AN ADVISORY REVIEW, NOT A RECORDED VERDICT.`):

```bash
gh pr view {{PR_NUM}} --json title,body,comments --repo {{REPO}}
```

Take the **latest** such comment as the authoritative ask — read its findings table and its
`**Advisory outcome:** \`changes\`` line. Everything else in step 2 above still applies unchanged: reproduce the
finding red before you touch code, and if it is ambiguous or needs judgment you cannot safely make, **stand
down** exactly as step 2 says (`stand-down.mjs {{PR_NUM}} --reason=needs-judgment`) — this population is never
exempt from that escalation path. **Do NOT** treat this comment as a human-ceremony bounce: it explicitly is
not one (its own text says so, twice), so nothing here ever touches `review:human`, `review:pending`, or
`review:accepted` — this repair's only output is the fix itself plus the durable marker at step 7a.

> **If you genuinely cannot reproduce the finding because it was ALREADY FIXED — this is GOOD NEWS, not a
> judgment call, and you must NOT stand down** (#xkmu3gv incident, CONFIRMED LIVE on `web-everything/web-everything
> #2549`, 2026-09-24: a fixer correctly found nothing to fix, then wrongly stood down anyway, freezing the PR).
> A `stand-down` is TERMINAL and reserved for a genuine judgment call your read of the finding could not safely
> make — it is never the right exit for "there was nothing left to do here". Tell the two apart by re-reading
> the thread: if an EARLIER comment already shows an advisory-fix marker (leading line `🔧 conveyor fix —
> advisory finding addressed`) posted AFTER the latest advisory-panel comment, or your own repro attempt shows
> the described behavior simply does not occur on this HEAD and nothing else about the finding is ambiguous,
> the finding is already addressed. In that case, skip straight to **7a. Advisory-fix hand-back** below (still
> post your reproduce-attempt evidence per step 2's own discipline first) and report `#{{ITEM_NUM}} → PR
> #{{PR_NUM}} (advisory finding already addressed — a fresh review is owed next, not by this agent)`. Reserve
> `stand-down.mjs` in this mode for a finding that is genuinely ambiguous or requires a judgment call you
> cannot safely make on its own terms — never merely because a prior round already closed it out.

### 3. Apply the fix — repair ONLY the reviewer's finding

Make the smallest change that addresses the finding, in `$LANE`, on the lane's **current branch** (its local
`main` — do **NOT** `git checkout -b`; the single-branch hook blocks branch creation even in a lane clone).
Keep scope tight: the repair's files should stay within `{{SCOPE}}`. Do not fold in unrelated work, and do not
weaken or delete a test to sidestep the finding.

**Change a tracked file's content (source, a backlog card, docs) with the Edit/Write tool — never a `Bash`
rewrite** (a `python`/`node`/`sed` heredoc or one-liner that reads the file and overwrites it). Even inside
your own lane clone, where Bash is fully permitted, a Bash command whose EFFECT is to rewrite a git-tracked
file can be denied by Claude Code's own auto-mode permission classifier as `[Modify Shared Resources]`, with
nobody watching this session to answer it — confirmed live on PR #2518 (`fix-2518`, 2026-09-23): a `python3`
heredoc rewriting `backlog/3945-*.md` was denied exactly this way, and the fix agent then (wrongly) treated
the denial as a judgment call rather than the tooling failure it actually was. Edit/Write is the sanctioned,
already-allow-listed surface for this — reach for it first (see *If applying the fix is denied* below for what
to do if it, or anything else, gets refused).

**If applying an otherwise-CLEAR fix is denied by a permission or tool-use guard, that is INFRASTRUCTURE
FRICTION, not a judgment call — do NOT stand down.** The reviewer's finding still says exactly what to do; only
the *mechanism* to do it failed. Report it as `blocked-on-permission` with `--denied="<the exact denied command,
one line>"` — never `stand-down.mjs`, which is terminal and reserved for a genuine judgment call (see step 2). A
permission wall does not clear by waiting, so the reconciler surfaces it at once and holds retries for 60 minutes
(`we:scripts/conveyor/reconcile-core.mjs#PERMISSION_BLOCKED_COOLOFF_MS`) until the product grows a sanctioned
path. Keep `blocked-on-infra` (no `--denied`) for outages and rate limits.

```bash
node "{{WE_ROOT}}/scripts/operations/completion-cli.mjs" report --repo={{REPO}} --session={{SESSION_SLUG}} --status=done --outcome=blocked-on-permission --denied="<the exact denied command, one line>"
node "{{WE_ROOT}}/scripts/conveyor/fix-procedure.mjs" fix-end {{PR_NUM}} --repo={{REPO}} --who={{SESSION_SLUG}}
```

Then report `#{{ITEM_NUM}} → blocked-on-permission (tool/permission denial applying an otherwise-clear fix on PR
#{{PR_NUM}})` and exit — do not retry the same denied action yourself in a loop, and do not fall back to a
Bash rewrite to work around the denial (that is the exact shape that got denied).

**Resolve against this PR's OWN base branch, never an assumed `main`** (#3383). Most PRs base off `main`, but a
**stacked** PR (built on another still-open lane/PR — `#poc-branch-declared-delivery-mode` clause 5) does not, and
merging `main` into a PR based on something else would pull in the wrong history entirely. Confirm the real base
LIVE, every time — never trust a value you were told earlier in this dispatch, since GitHub RETARGETS a stacked
PR to `main` automatically the moment its base branch merges and is deleted (the normal, expected path):

```bash
gh pr view {{PR_NUM}} --json baseRefName --repo {{REPO}} --jq .baseRefName
```

**This is the only point in this brief where you may touch `origin/main` at all, and at most once (#4297) —
never fetch or merge it speculatively anywhere else in the repair, and only when it actually blocks the gate
right now, never pre-emptively.**

When this catch-up is needed, use a real merge of the live PR base. Preserve upstream commit identities;
never cherry-pick a range of main commits or reconstruct upstream merges. Save local repairs in a commit
first. A failed merge needs resolution (or `git merge --abort` before the stand-down below); after resolving,
complete the merge and rerun the ancestry check against the saved `BASE_SHA` before the gate.

```bash
BASE_REF=$(gh pr view {{PR_NUM}} --repo {{REPO}} --json baseRefName --jq .baseRefName)
test -n "$BASE_REF" || exit 1
git fetch origin "$BASE_REF" || exit 1
BASE_SHA=$(git rev-parse FETCH_HEAD) || exit 1
git merge --no-edit "$BASE_SHA" || exit 1
git merge-base --is-ancestor "$BASE_SHA" HEAD || exit 1
```

To take one side of a conflicted file, or union both, use ONLY
`node {{WE_ROOT}}/scripts/conveyor/resolve-conflict.mjs --dir=<your lane path> --file=<path> --take=ours|theirs|union`
(unquoted script path, exactly this shape; pre-allowed in this session's settings).
NEVER use `git checkout --ours/--theirs`, `git checkout -- <file>`, `git restore`, or `git reset` on a file:
the auto-mode classifier denies those as "[Irreversible Local Destruction]" (live: fix-3964, PR #3964).
Hand-merged hunks still use the Edit tool, then `git add`.

If `origin/main` advanced under the lane and a **conflict**
blocks the gate, resolve it the `/finish` way (regenerate derived artifacts, take-main for coordination JSON) —
or, if it is a genuine same-line code overlap you cannot safely resolve, **record the stand-down on the PR
first** (`#xu2krte` — this call was missing here until then; only the *manual* `/finish` path posted it, so an
auto-dispatched escalation was silently re-dispatched at the same unresolved conflict next tick, bounded only
by the 5-attempt rearm cap instead of this terminal exit), THEN report the completion record and stop. (This is
written against `main` because that is the common case — see the STACKED-BASE MODE note below for a PR whose own
base is something else; the same reproduce/resolve/escalate discipline applies either way, just against a
different ref.)

```bash
node "{{WE_ROOT}}/scripts/conveyor/stand-down.mjs" {{PR_NUM}} --repo={{REPO}} --who={{SESSION_SLUG}} --reason=conflict \
  --detail="<one line — what made the overlap unsafe to resolve automatically>"
node "{{WE_ROOT}}/scripts/operations/completion-cli.mjs" report --repo={{REPO}} --session={{SESSION_SLUG}} --status=done --outcome=escalated-conflict
node "{{WE_ROOT}}/scripts/conveyor/fix-procedure.mjs" fix-end {{PR_NUM}} --repo={{REPO}} --who={{SESSION_SLUG}}
```

Then report `#{{ITEM_NUM}} → fix escalated (conflict with main)`.

**Build-brief discipline applies to the repair too** (statute:
[we:docs/agent/platform-decisions.md#build-brief-discipline](../../../docs/agent/platform-decisions.md#build-brief-discipline),
#2819): if the reviewer's finding names a category ("reject X") without enumerating its shapes, name the
concrete edge cases yourself rather than the first narrow guess; cover the repair with an integration/wiring
test if the finding touches a call path, not only a unit test of the isolated piece; and never claim the repair
"closes" or "fixes" the item in your commit unless it truly does end-to-end.

**Fix the class, not the instance.** Before editing, write a short variant list: the defect class in one line, each shape of it you can name (for input handling: quoting, escaping, concatenation, encoding, alternate Unicode), and every call site with the same pattern (`git grep` the helper or the pattern). Fix every variant inside `{{SCOPE}}`. A variant outside `{{SCOPE}}` is listed with the file and filed through `file-item`, never silently left.

### 4. Run the gate GREEN (the item's own locus gate)

**The harness owns the wait, not you (#5137).** The gate verifies a COMMIT and the harness pushes exactly that
commit, so first finish step 5's self-review, re-run the step-2 test (below), and make step 6's commit — but NOT
its push. Then hand the wait over:

```bash
node {{WE_ROOT}}/scripts/verify-lane.mjs request --repo=.                        # returns almost instantly — nothing has run yet
node {{WE_ROOT}}/scripts/conveyor/await-verify.mjs mark --repo={{REPO}} --pr={{PR_NUM}} --who={{SESSION_SLUG}} --ref={{LANE_REF}} --kind=fix --attempt=1
```

Then **end your turn**: reply with one line (`awaiting verify for <sha>`) and stop. Never `check --wait`, never
`sleep`, never `run_in_background`, never read output files in a loop (#x36vidg), never `reset` or re-`request`
yourself. `mark` refuses a dirty tree or a sha that is not HEAD — commit first. The fix daemon reads the verdict
every tick and resumes THIS session with a message that starts `[harness verify verdict — #5137]`.

A dispatched agent cannot run the gate itself: `we:scripts/guard-bash.mjs` denies any `verify-lane.mjs` invocation
except `request` / `check` / `reset` (#3105) — including a bare `run --repo=.` and `run` wrapped in
`heavy-admission.mjs`. Write the script path **unquoted** (the guard needs whitespace right after `.mjs`; a
quoted path is denied). Do not run `verify-lane.mjs run` here; `request` stamps a marker the verify runner
(`we:scripts/conveyor/verify-dispatch.mjs`) picks up and settles with the same diff-selected gate.

The harness acts on the same verdict `verify-lane.mjs check` prints — the **`check` output**, never the `request`
acknowledgement — and the resume message tells you which branch you are on:
`green` → the harness has already pushed your exact sha to `{{LANE_REF}}`; continue at step 6's evidence comment
and never push `{{LANE_REF}}` yourself. `red` (exit 2) → the failing tests are in the message: repair, commit,
`request`, `mark` again with `--attempt=<n+1>`, and end your turn; on the third red the message tells you to take
the gate-red hard stop below. A red the gate classifies as load-only → the message tells you to take the load-flake
exit below. `infrastructure-failure` or no verdict → the harness re-requests on its own; after repeated failures
the message tells you to report the stalled request with the blocked-on-infra exit (the signal/ceiling evidence,
without claiming a test failure). A moved or dirty lane → re-commit, `request`, `mark` again.
Other statuses follow [we:skills-src/conveyor/delivery-agent-brief.md](delivery-agent-brief.md).

After the harness pushes, do not wait on CI or the merge — finish the hand-back, report and exit.

If the repair also touches a WE-side file (docs, the backlog item itself, WE-side glue) — i.e. `{{SCOPE}}` names
anything outside `{{REPO}}` — additionally run `npm run check:standards` from `{{WE_ROOT}}` before step 4's `request`:
the gate is `{{REPO}}`'s own gate and does not check WE's cross-repo invariants. For WE itself
(`{{REPO}}` == WE), the gate already includes WE's own check:standards (scoped to your diff), so this is
a no-op today.

**The gate is the diff-selected gate** (`verify-lane.mjs`, xpnhz4o): it runs **only the tests your
diff reaches** (`vitest related` on the files changed vs `origin/main`, working tree included, plus the tests that
name a changed file) and a check:standards scoped to those files. Shared helpers use that same graph and reference discovery. Unknown, unsafe or oversized selections
return `selection-required`; inspect the scope and supply an explicit affected-test gate, or report the blocker. In that blocked case `request --gate=…` accepts only an
affected-test shape — `&&`-joined `npx vitest related <files…> --run` / `vitest run <files…>` (only the `--run`/`--bail`
flags: never `--passWithNoTests`, `--config`, `--reporter`, `-t`…) / `npm run test:unit` / `npm test` (no arguments) /
`npm run check:standards` segments, no `||`, `;`, `|` or redirection — and refuses anything else (`gate-refused`; a refusal
at run time leaves a red marker).
It never expands a default local selection into the full suite. **Never run the full suite yourself**
(`npm run test:unit`, `npm test`, a bare `vitest run`): the verify runner runs the same gate for you, CI runs it
anyway, and the Bash guard denies it.
For any test run of your own (e.g. re-running one test file), use the queued form only — `node {{WE_ROOT}}/scripts/readiness/heavy-admission.mjs run -- npx vitest run <test-file>` or `npm run test:unit -- <test-file>`; a direct `npx vitest`, `npm test` or bare `check-standards.mjs` run skips the host's heavy-run queue and the Bash guard denies it.
To debug one or two tests, run `npm run test:unit -- <file(s)>` (≤5 files, 8-minute cap); it uses the fast lane. Run the full verify (request + mark + end turn, per the await flow in step 4) once before the harness pushes — never push yourself.

A green gate proves the **checks** pass; it does not, by itself, prove the reviewer's finding is actually fixed.
Re-run the SAME test from step 2 before you request verify — it must now be green — and, where the finding had a real-surface probe,
re-run that SAME probe and confirm it now shows the fixed behavior. Keep the trimmed after-output next to the
before-output from step 2; step 6 posts both as the evidence.

**Load-flake exception.** When verify is red ONLY on timeouts that pass alone under high host load, save and push
the fix to `lane/<head>-fix-<N>-alt`, then use the load-flake exit instead of the terminal gate-red exit below. It
releases the fix claim like every other exit. Pass the PR's FULL 40-character head sha (`git rev-parse origin/<head ref>`).
Only `web-everything/web-everything` has a reverify worker; for any other repo the script records the terminal
gate-red stand-down instead (a hold nothing would ever retry), so use the gate-red exit below there:

```bash
node "{{WE_ROOT}}/scripts/conveyor/stand-down.mjs" {{PR_NUM}} --repo={{REPO}} --who={{SESSION_SLUG}} --reason=load-flake --head=<pr-head-sha> --alt=<saved-alt-branch> --alt-sha=<saved-sha>
node "{{WE_ROOT}}/scripts/operations/completion-cli.mjs" report --repo={{REPO}} --session={{SESSION_SLUG}} --status=done --outcome=blocked-on-load-flake
node "{{WE_ROOT}}/scripts/conveyor/fix-procedure.mjs" fix-end {{PR_NUM}} --repo={{REPO}} --who={{SESSION_SLUG}}
```

Report `blocked-on-load-flake` and exit; the quiet-host reverify pass retries the saved fix automatically.

**Otherwise a red gate is a hard stop.** Record the stand-down on the PR, leave it `review:changes` (do **not**
re-arm), and RETURN `#{{ITEM_NUM}} → fix gate-red`. Do not re-push a red diff.

```bash
node "{{WE_ROOT}}/scripts/conveyor/stand-down.mjs" {{PR_NUM}} --repo={{REPO}} --who={{SESSION_SLUG}} --reason=gate-red \
  --detail="<one line — which check stayed red>"
node "{{WE_ROOT}}/scripts/operations/completion-cli.mjs" report --repo={{REPO}} --session={{SESSION_SLUG}} --status=done --outcome=gate-red
node "{{WE_ROOT}}/scripts/conveyor/fix-procedure.mjs" fix-end {{PR_NUM}} --repo={{REPO}} --who={{SESSION_SLUG}}
```

Same reason as the exit in step 2 (#3296): without the durable marker the reconcile pass cannot tell your
deliberate stop from a crash, and re-dispatches a fixer at this PR forever.

### 5. Converge before handback — self-review the repair (proportionate to the change)

Run this BEFORE step 4's `request`: the harness pushes exactly the commit it verified, so review comes first.

For anything beyond a trivial one-liner, spawn **one adversarial code-review subagent** on your repair diff and
**AWAIT its returned report as the verdict** — the same converge-before-handback discipline the delivery brief
uses ([we:skills-src/conveyor/delivery-agent-brief.md](delivery-agent-brief.md) step 6). Ask the subagent three things: does the repair meet the reviewer's finding, does the repair itself introduce a new problem, and **what is the next variant of the same defect class that still gets through?** A same-class variant it names inside `{{SCOPE}}` is must-fix before re-push. A defect the repair itself introduces is must-fix regardless of class — "not the same class" never dismisses it. You may dismiss any other self-review finding only as "not the same class" or "outside `{{SCOPE}}` (filed as <card>)". Deferring ("later", "follow-up") is not a dismissal. Only then commit and request verify (step 4). A trivial, obviously-correct fix (a typo, a
pinned-count bump) may skip the subagent — but never skip re-reading the reviewer's finding to confirm you met it.

### 6. Commit (before step 4's request) — the harness re-pushes it to the SAME lane ref

Commit only the repair's files (explicit paths, never `git add -A`; one commit) on the lane's current branch,
BEFORE step 4's `request`. Do **not** push `{{LANE_REF}}` yourself: on a green verdict for exactly this commit the
harness pushes it to `{{LANE_REF}}` — this **updates the existing PR**, it does not open a new one (never
`gh pr create`, never `pr-land` — the PR already exists):

```bash
printf '%s\n' "{{ATTRIBUTION}}: fix — <specific correction> (PR {{PR_NUM}})" "" \
  "Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.8 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>" > <msgfile>
git commit -F <msgfile> <explicit-paths>
```

**If the harness reports the push was rejected because the branch moved** (someone else pushed while you worked — rare now that
the fix claim refuses other pushes, but a push from outside the guarded paths can still land), do not force and
do not merge two designs. Save your repair on a side branch, record a **pause** (not a stand-down — it is not
terminal and needs no person), release the claim, and return:

```bash
git push origin HEAD:refs/heads/{{LANE_REF}}-fix-{{PR_NUM}}-alt
node "{{WE_ROOT}}/scripts/conveyor/stand-down.mjs" {{PR_NUM}} --repo={{REPO}} --who={{SESSION_SLUG}} --reason=concurrent-author \
  --head="$(git ls-remote origin refs/heads/{{LANE_REF}} | cut -f1)" --alt={{LANE_REF}}-fix-{{PR_NUM}}-alt \
  --alt-sha="$(git rev-parse HEAD)" --detail="<one line — what the other author changed>"
node "{{WE_ROOT}}/scripts/operations/completion-cli.mjs" report --repo={{REPO}} --session={{SESSION_SLUG}} --status=done --outcome=not-applicable
node "{{WE_ROOT}}/scripts/conveyor/fix-procedure.mjs" fix-end {{PR_NUM}} --repo={{REPO}} --who={{SESSION_SLUG}}
```

The planner re-arms the PR on its own once the head moves again or goes quiet, and the next fixer is told to
start from your saved branch. Never use `--reason=conflict` for this — that is a same-line conflict with `main`.

Write the commit message to a file and `commit -F` it — a heredoc runs backticks (e.g. `` `scope:` ``) as a
subshell (`bad substitution`); a message file has no such footgun. Pushing to `lane/*` is allowed by the
single-branch guard; pushing to `main` is not.

**Post the before/after proof as a PR comment before re-arming.** A reviewer must be able to SEE that the fix
works, not just infer it from a green gate: post a comment carrying the trimmed red output (step 2) followed by
the trimmed green output (step 4) — or, if reproduction was genuinely impossible, the explicit statement of why
(step 2). The comment must also carry a `Variants considered:` block: the list from step 3, each marked fixed, or out of scope + card.

```bash
gh pr comment {{PR_NUM}} --repo {{REPO}} --body-file <evidence-file>
```

Do this before step 7's re-arm, so the evidence is already on the PR the moment a human (or the drain's
AI-review pass) looks at it.

### 7. Re-arm the review — hand back for re-review (NEVER self-clear the human gate)

The bounce is repaired and re-pushed; now hand it back. This is **the one label swap you may make** — and it is
a script, so you cannot route around the invariant:

```bash
node "{{WE_ROOT}}/scripts/conveyor/rearm-review.mjs" {{PR_NUM}} --repo={{REPO}} && \
  node "{{WE_ROOT}}/scripts/operations/completion-cli.mjs" report --repo={{REPO}} --session={{SESSION_SLUG}} --status=done --outcome=re-armed
  node "{{WE_ROOT}}/scripts/conveyor/fix-procedure.mjs" fix-end {{PR_NUM}} --repo={{REPO}} --who={{SESSION_SLUG}}
```

`rearm-review.mjs` swaps `review:changes → review:pending` (an independent re-review is owed) and posts a
durable re-arm comment. It **NEVER** emits `review:accepted` and **NEVER** removes `review:human` — a gate-self
bounce stays human-ceremony-only. So the strongest thing you can do is re-arm the review; the human (via
`/review`) or the drain's AI-review convergence pass re-verdicts. **Do NOT** `gh pr edit --add-label
review:accepted`, **do NOT** merge, **do NOT** run a drain. If the script refuses (the PR no longer carries
`review:changes` — e.g. a human already re-touched it), report the completion record and stop and report it;
do not force a label:

```bash
node "{{WE_ROOT}}/scripts/operations/completion-cli.mjs" report --repo={{REPO}} --session={{SESSION_SLUG}} --status=done --outcome=escalated-rearm-refused
node "{{WE_ROOT}}/scripts/conveyor/fix-procedure.mjs" fix-end {{PR_NUM}} --repo={{REPO}} --who={{SESSION_SLUG}}
```

### 7a. Advisory-fix hand-back (#xkmu3gv — use instead of step 7 in ADVISORY-FIX MODE only)

There is no `review:changes` to swap here, so there is **no label to touch at all** — post the durable
advisory-fix marker instead:

```bash
node "{{WE_ROOT}}/scripts/conveyor/advisory-fix-mark.mjs" {{PR_NUM}} --repo={{REPO}} && \
  node "{{WE_ROOT}}/scripts/operations/completion-cli.mjs" report --repo={{REPO}} --session={{SESSION_SLUG}} --status=done --outcome=re-armed
  node "{{WE_ROOT}}/scripts/conveyor/fix-procedure.mjs" fix-end {{PR_NUM}} --repo={{REPO}} --who={{SESSION_SLUG}}
```

`advisory-fix-mark.mjs` posts one comment recording that the advisory finding was addressed. It **NEVER**
touches `review:human`, `review:pending`, `review:changes`, or any `advisory:*` label, and it records **no**
verdict — only the next `advise` run (a fresh `review` dispatch, already owed automatically once this comment
outnumbers the prior advisory note) may change any of those, by judging the repaired head fresh. **Do NOT** run
`gh pr edit`, **do NOT** run `rearm-review.mjs` here (there is nothing for it to rearm), **do NOT** merge.

### 8. Append a structured learnings entry to the session drop-box (#2614)

Append **exactly one** generalized-lesson entry (a friction hit, a missing convention, a doc/skill gap, an
improvement idea) from the repair — a write-time-gated scrub that rejects raw code, diffs, secrets,
absolute/repo paths, or PII, so keep every field a short generalized lesson:

```bash
node "{{WE_ROOT}}/scripts/conveyor/learnings-drop.mjs" \
  --kind=<friction|missing-convention|doc-gap|skill-gap|improvement> \
  --summary="<one sentence — the lesson>" \
  --area="<coarse label, e.g. review-changes repair / re-arm>" \
  --suggestion="<short recommendation>" \
  --session={{SESSION_SLUG}}
```

Skip only if you genuinely hit no generalizable friction.

### 9. EXIT — do not merge, do not clear review, do not release

**Stop here.** Do NOT run `gh pr merge`. Do NOT run a drain. Do NOT `release` the lane. Do NOT set
`review:accepted`. Your process EXIT is the signal you are done; the conveyor's merge watcher
(`scripts/conveyor/pr-watch.mjs {{PR_NUM}}`) is re-armed by the conveyor skill, sees the PR return to
`review:pending` (still parked, exit 2), and surfaces it for `/review`. Return a one-line result:
`#{{ITEM_NUM}} → PR #{{PR_NUM}} (re-armed review:pending | fix escalated <reason> | fix gate-red)`, or, for the
tooling-denial exit in step 3, `#{{ITEM_NUM}} → blocked-on-permission (<exact denied command>)`, or, for ADVISORY-FIX MODE (step 7a),
`#{{ITEM_NUM}} → PR #{{PR_NUM}} (advisory finding addressed — a fresh review is owed next, not by this agent)`,
or, for STACKED-BASE MODE, `#{{ITEM_NUM}} → PR #{{PR_NUM}} (stacked-base conflict resolved against <baseRefName> —
review labels untouched)`.
A red gate / red CI / a blocked-on-infra exit is NOT watcher-visible — your one-line RETURN is the only signal
that surfaces it, so always report it.

## Manual take-over — the human `/finish` path (SAME procedure)

The auto path above and a human repairing a bounce by hand are **one procedure**, so a human doesn't reinvent
it. When a human takes over a `review:changes` bounce (the `/finish` `review-changes` bucket, or directly):

0. **Take the fix claim first** — `node "{{WE_ROOT}}/scripts/conveyor/fix-procedure.mjs" fix-begin {{PR_NUM}}
   --repo={{REPO}} --who=<you> --why="<one line>"` (step 0b above), and `fix-end` after the push. A human or
   orchestrator worker is no exception: the #2811 incident was exactly an unclaimed second author.
1. **Reconstitute the ref, don't rebuild.** Clone / acquire on `{{LANE_REF}}` (`/finish` clones the ref;
   `acquire --base=<ref>` does the same for a pool lane). Reuse the ~done work.
2. **Read the reviewer's finding** off the PR's latest changes-requested comment (step 2 above).
3. **Repair only the finding**, resolve any conflict the `/finish` way (regenerate derived artifacts; take-main
   for coordination JSON; STOP on a genuine same-line overlap), get the locus gate green (steps 3–5 above).
   To take one side of a conflicted file, or union both, use ONLY
   `node {{WE_ROOT}}/scripts/conveyor/resolve-conflict.mjs --dir=<your lane path> --file=<path> --take=ours|theirs|union`
   (unquoted script path, exactly this shape; pre-allowed in this session's settings).
   NEVER use `git checkout --ours/--theirs`, `git checkout -- <file>`, `git restore`, or `git reset` on a file:
   the auto-mode classifier denies those as "[Irreversible Local Destruction]" (live: fix-3964, PR #3964).
   Hand-merged hunks still use the Edit tool, then `git add`.
   If you stop instead, run `node "{{WE_ROOT}}/scripts/conveyor/stand-down.mjs" {{PR_NUM}} --repo={{REPO}} --reason=conflict`
   so the PR records that a repair was attempted and deliberately abandoned — the auto-fix loop then leaves it
   to you (#3296).
4. **Re-push HEAD to the same `lane/*` ref** — update the PR in place, never open a new one (step 6 above).
5. **Re-arm, never clear.** Hand back with `node "{{WE_ROOT}}/scripts/conveyor/rearm-review.mjs" {{PR_NUM}} --repo={{REPO}}` — the same
   invariant-guarded swap (`review:changes → review:pending`; never `review:accepted`; never removes
   `review:human`). A human still clears the eventual re-review via `/review` — repairing a bounce is not
   accepting it.

The only difference between auto and manual is **who** applies the finding; the reuse-the-ref, repair-only,
re-push, re-arm-never-clear shape is identical — which is the point (#2630).

## Guardrails (the non-negotiables)

- **Never edit the primary checkout** — all work is in the acquired lane clone (#104/#2183).
- **Never merge, never self-clear the review** — you stop at `review:pending` (re-armed); a human `/review` (or
  the drain AI-review) verdicts, and the drain daemon is the sole writer to `main`. `review:human` is never
  touched by a fix agent.
- **Reuse the ref, never rebuild** — reconstitute from `{{LANE_REF}}`; if the ref is gone or the item is
  unrecoverable, report it, don't silently redo the item.
- **Repair only the finding** — do not fold unrelated work in; do not weaken or delete a test to go green.
- **Prove it, don't just gate it** — reproduce the finding red (step 2), re-confirm it green (step 4), and post
  the trimmed before/after evidence as a PR comment (step 6) before you re-arm. A genuine non-repro is stated
  explicitly, with the reason — never silently skipped.
- **Work only through the normal verbs** — `acquire --base=<ref>` → repair → commit → `verify-lane.mjs request` +
  `await-verify.mjs mark` → end turn (the harness pushes `lane/*` on green) →
  `rearm-review.mjs` (or, in ADVISORY-FIX MODE, `advisory-fix-mark.mjs` — never `rearm-review.mjs`, there is no
  `review:changes` to swap) → daemon/human re-review. No parallel state store (#2612 ruling).
- **ADVISORY-FIX MODE never touches any `review:*` or `advisory:*` label** (#xkmu3gv) — its only output is the
  fix itself and the durable marker at step 7a; the NEXT `review` dispatch (already owed automatically, not run
  by this agent) is what may change a label, by judging the repaired head fresh.
- **A mechanical conflict-resolution round hands back with `rearm-review.mjs --round=conflict`** (#xkmu3gv), so
  it counts against its own smaller cap — the plain form would silently spend the ordinary negotiation cap
  instead.
- **Always resolve a conflict against the PR's own `baseRefName`, read LIVE, never an assumed `main`** (#3383) —
  most PRs base off `main`, but a stacked PR does not, and GitHub retargets a stacked PR to `main` automatically
  once its base merges and is deleted, so the live value can differ from what this dispatch was planned against.
- **STACKED-BASE MODE never touches any `review:*` label** (#3383) — its only output is the fix itself and the
  durable marker via `conflict-fix-mark.mjs` (never `rearm-review.mjs`, there is no `review:changes` to swap);
  it counts against the SAME `CONFLICT_FIX_ROUND_CAP` the ordinary main-base conflict-fix round uses.
- **A daemon bug fix adds its real-world case to the daemon soak harness** (#4075, card xg6m4i5). If your repair
  fixes a bug in daemon code — anything under `we:skills-src/conveyor/`, `we:scripts/conveyor/`,
  `we:scripts/lib/daemon-*`, `we:scripts/lane-pool*`, `we:scripts/review-set-label.mjs` or
  `we:scripts/operations/*dispatch*` — add the live case as a scenario in `we:scripts/conveyor/soak/breaks/`
  (one module + its `.soak.test.mjs` wrapper, registered in `we:scripts/conveyor/soak/breaks/index.mjs`), and
  post the proof with your before/after evidence: `node "$LANE/scripts/conveyor/soak/red-green.mjs" --break=<id>`
  (the copy in YOUR WE lane — it tests the tree it lives in) must print RED on the tree before your fix and GREEN
  with it. A unit test alone is not enough: seven live daemon
  breaks on 2026-09-25 were all green in unit tests. **This is now MECHANICALLY enforced**, not just written
  here (`we:.github/workflows/soak-replay-gate.yml` → `we:scripts/lib/soak-replay-gate.mjs`, #4075): a PR
  touching daemon-soak scope that reads as a bug fix and adds no `we:scripts/conveyor/soak/breaks/` file goes
  red unless its body carries a `soak-waiver: <reason>` line — a non-empty, explicit reason why this fix does
  not need one (e.g. it doesn't reproduce as a daemon-soak scenario, or an existing break already covers it).
  Don't reach for the waiver as a shortcut: it exists for the genuine exception, not to skip the work.
- **If you stop, say so ON THE PR** — every escalation exit runs `stand-down.mjs` before it returns (#3296). A
  refusal that leaves no durable trace is indistinguishable from a crash, and gets re-dispatched forever. The
  marker changes no label; it is terminal for the auto-fix loop and cleared by a human.
