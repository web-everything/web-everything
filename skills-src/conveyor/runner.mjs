 * @file skills-src/conveyor/runner.mjs
 * @description The conveyor HEADLESS RUNNER (WE #2702, epic #2677(b), the DELEGATE half) — a SINGLETON-LOCKED,
 *   no-LLM runner that drives the mechanized tick core ({@link ../../scripts/conveyor/tick-core.mjs}, #2699)
 *   for the conveyor. It reads state and STEPS the tested state machine — it spends NO model context per tick
 *   (memory rule / #2701 clause 1): every guard, TTL, re-dispatch gate, watcher-arm, and idle-stop decision is
 *   the tick core's, applied deterministically; the runner is a THIN SHELL that threads the core's `nextState`
 *   into the next tick UNCHANGED and SURFACES the tick's decisions. It never re-derives a guard rule.
 *
 * WHAT #2701 SETTLES (the ratified mechanics-not-agent boundary, codified at
 *   [we:docs/agent/platform-decisions.md#conveyor-orchestration-mechanics-not-per-lane-agent]):
 *   1. The per-lane driver is a headless runner over the tested tick-core state machine — no per-tick model
 *      context. THIS file is that runner.
 *   2. NO per-lane conducting agent (Option B rejected) — so this is ONE singleton-locked runner, not an
 *      always-on LLM conductor per lane. The singleton right is held by {@link ./runner-lock.mjs}.
 *   3. A single supervisor is deferred (Option C) and genuine NOVELTY escalates to the main-session judgment
 *      layer — the runner never improvises a ruling. So the runner EMITS its dispatch/watch decisions
 *      ({@link tickSurface}) for the judgment layer to execute; it does not itself spawn LLM delivery agents.
 *
 * SCOPE (#2702, NOT #2703): this builds the runner MECHANISM — the singleton lock + the loop that steps the
 *   core, carries bookkeeping, runs the deterministic no-LLM passes (infra-blocked recovery §4b, lease-reaper
 *   §4c, session-reaper §4d, the reconcile-fix dispatch pass #3438), and surfaces the tick. It does NOT retire
 *   the main-session serial loop (that is #2703, blocked on this) and does NOT wire headless LLM agent-spawning
 *   (the CLI agent-runner backend,
 *   [#agent-runner-cli-backend]) — both belong to the retirement slice. The guard SEMANTICS are PRESERVED
 *   verbatim: they live in the tick core; the runner alters none of them.
 *
 * PURE-CORE / IO-SHELL SPLIT (the hard design constraint, mirrored from tick-core.mjs):
 *   • The PURE core ({@link carryForward}, {@link shouldStop}, {@link tickSurface}, {@link runLoop}) has NO
 *     fs / child_process / clock of its own — every effect (stepping a tick, the mechanical passes, emitting,
 *     heartbeating the lease, sleeping) is INJECTED. `runLoop` is the runner's whole control flow, unit-tested
 *     (skills-src/conveyor/__tests__/runner.test.mjs) with fake effects — no git/network, no real lease.
 *   • The IO SHELL (the `main()` CLI + the `cli*` effect builders, gated on the main-module check) shells
 *     `tick-core.mjs` (bookkeeping in on STDIN, `{ decisions, nextState }` out), runs the two deterministic
 *     passes, prints the surface, and heartbeats the real singleton lease.

 *  real merge conflict against `main`, catching exactly the axis branch-drift's single-branch watch and #2824's
 *  BEHIND-only freshness gate both leave uncovered), the general PR-landing-progress watch (we:3550 —
 *  `we:scripts/conveyor/parked-pr-progress-watch.mjs sweep`: flags a review-parked PR sitting past a
 *  configurable threshold with no independent review ever dispatched for it — the neglect axis neither
 *  sibling watch above catches), the review-reconcile pass (epic #3383, x5v8yy9 — reads
 *  `conveyor/reconcile-pass.mjs`'s own decision and dispatches `operations/review-dispatch.mjs` for every PR it
 *  names, plus the purely-informative `review-round-tag.mjs`/`review-status-tag.mjs` labels — the review step
 *  is now actually mechanized, not merely planned; see {@link selectStatusCandidates} for which PRs the status
 *  refresh covers), (#3421) the blocking-hiccup sink, and the CI queue-wait watch (#3574 — `we:scripts/

 *  to a durable sidecar history, the SAME "piggyback on a pass this headless runner already ticks" shape
 *  branch-drift above uses, so a genuine Actions run-queue regression becomes a visible trend instead of
 *  invisible; purely informative — no dispatch gate reads its verdict). All ten are best-effort: a failure is
 *  swallowed (logged to stderr) and never gates the tick. Never a local merge — the drain stays the sole writer
 *  to `main`.
 *
 *  THE REVIEW-RECONCILE PASS needs no session-ephemeral bookkeeping of its own, unlike the tick's own
 *  build/prepare/fix/ci-heal guards: `reconcile-pass.mjs` reads real ground truth (findings on the PR, a live
 *  `claude agents` session bound to it via cwd/HEAD sha) every time it runs, so it can just be re-run every
 *  tick, safely — the same way `infra-blocked.mjs`/`lease-reaper.mjs` already are. Double-dispatch is already
 *  guarded UPSTREAM, not here: `reconcile-core.mjs`'s own liveness read binds a live session to a PR and
 *  refuses (`live-process`) BEFORE the `review` dispatch decision is ever reached, so a review already in
 *  flight for a PR simply does not appear in next tick's plan.
 *
 *  THE HICCUP SINK is the ONLY one of the eight that reads `out` (this tick's already-computed
 *  `decisions.suppressedBuilds` — the #3416 guard-suppression shape): it is the mechanical half of #3421's
 *  auto-file-a-fix story, filing a gated `blocking` learnings entry the moment a live guard holds a
 *  dispatch, rather than waiting for a human `/note`. It files NOTHING for the #3412 free-form-response
 *  shape — this runner spawns no LLM agents (#2701 clause 3) and so never observes an agent's return; that
 *  classification is the judgment layer's own job (skills-src/conveyor/SKILL.md), via the same

 * a restart instead of ticking on stale code), then the GitHub App TOKEN REFRESH
 * ({@link withGithubAppAuth} — opt-in via `WE_GITHUB_APP_*` env vars, a no-op otherwise), then the real tick.
 * This is the exact ordering `skills-src/conveyor/review-daemon.mjs`'s own `main()` already composes
 * (`withSelfSync(withGithubAppAuth(effects), {...})` — the OUTERMOST wrapper runs FIRST). Both wrappers
 * forward whatever arguments their wrapped `tickOnce` takes (see each module's own header), so the runner's
 * per-tick bookkeeping payload (threaded tick-to-tick via {@link carryForward}) still reaches the real
 * `tickOnce` unchanged — this function adds no IO of its own, only the composition.
 *
 * SELF-SYNC IS OPT-IN (`selfSync: true`, default OFF). Self-sync MUTATES the checkout (`git merge
 * origin/main`, then a restart) and is only safe in a DEDICATED unattended clone nobody else touches — the
 * precondition `daemon-self-sync.mjs` was designed around. runner.mjs is ALSO run interactively from the
 * operator's own live checkout (the /conveyor skill's documented flow), where an unasked-for merge commit or
 * a mid-session `process.exit(0)` is wrong. So unless the caller explicitly asserts "this is the dedicated
 * clone" (the CLI's `--self-sync` flag, which the staged launchd plist passes), only the App-token refresh
 * wraps the tick and no git mutation ever happens.

 *   `sync`/`gate` are forwarded to {@link withSelfSync} for back-compat call shape, but are UNUSED on its
 *   DEFAULT (non-POC) path since #4044 Module E replaced the merge-then-gate flow with a gated clone rebuild
 *   (`we:scripts/lib/daemon-rebuild.mjs#rebuildClone`) — `rebuild`/`mainOnly`/`acquireRead`/`releaseRead`/
 *   `readState` are the new equivalents, likewise forwarded only when the caller passes them (a real caller
 *   never does today; a test injects them to simulate a rebuild/lock outcome without a real git checkout or
