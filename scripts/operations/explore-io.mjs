/**
 * @file scripts/operations/explore-io.mjs
 * @description THE IO SHELL of the `explore` declaration (#3150, under epic #3029) — the SINK that starts one
 *   panelist's investigation, the OBSERVER that later asks how it went, and the two TERMINAL sinks a run may
 *   end on.
 *
 * WHY IT IS A SEPARATE FILE. {@link ./explore.mjs} is the declaration: what the operation IS. This is the only
 * place it touches the world — the same pure-core / io-shell split {@link ./dispatch-lane-io.mjs} and
 * {@link ./review-pr-io.mjs} use, and what lets the declaration be unit-tested with a two-line stub spawner.
 *
 * EVERY BINDING HERE SHELLS SOMETHING THAT ALREADY EXISTS, or writes one file:
 *   - the panelist spawn is `claude --bg --session-id <uuid>`, the SAME minted-handle contract
 *     `dispatch-lane`'s sink established (#3037) — the id is chosen before the agent exists, so the handle
 *     cannot be attributed to the wrong session;
 *   - the liveness axis is `claude agents --json`, asked exactly as the dispatch observer asks it;
 *   - filing a story is `we:scripts/backlog.mjs scaffold --json`, the real CLI — so JIT hash numbering (#2288),
 *     the skeleton renderer and the guarded write are ONE implementation, not a second one that drifts.
 *
 * ── WHERE A PANELIST'S REPORT LIVES, AND WHY IT IS NOT IN THE CHECKOUT ───────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A report is a file the DISPATCHED AGENT writes and this process later reads, which makes its location a
 * guard question rather than a taste question. `we:scripts/guard-lane.mjs` denies an `Edit`/`Write` whose real
 * path is inside a primary checkout, and (since #2997) also inside a lane clone whose live lease names a
 * DIFFERENT session as occupant. A panelist is by construction a different session from whoever started it, so
 * a report written under `<checkout>/.operations/` would be blocked in BOTH of the places an `explore` run
 * realistically executes — the primary checkout and an adopted lane.
 *
 * So the scratch root is a sibling of `.lanes/` at the WORKSPACE level: `<workspace>/.operations/explore/`.
 * {@link workspaceRootOf} is IMPORTED from the guard rather than re-derived, so the region this writes into and
 * the region the guard allows are one definition and cannot drift apart. It is session scratch, which is where
 * clause 1 of
 * [#state-lives-where-its-nature-dictates](../../docs/agent/platform-decisions.md#state-lives-where-its-nature-dictates)
 * puts it; nothing durable is stored there and no parallel state store comes into existence (#2612) — the run
 * record remains the only bookkeeping, and the report text is folded ONTO it by the observer.
 *
 * ── WHO RECLAIMS IT, AND WHEN (#2304) ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * THE WAKER DOES, on every pass, once the run is `complete`. `we:scripts/operations/wake.mjs` calls
 * {@link reclaimExploreScratch} after it has advanced the parked runs, so a committee the pass itself finished is
 * reclaimed in that same pass, and one finished by an operator's `--resume` is reclaimed on the next tick. The
 * waker was the only candidate that already runs on a timer and already reads every run record; a sink or
 * observer cannot do it, because neither is called again once the run has moved past them.
 *
 * THE UNIT IS THE RUN'S DIRECTORY, NEVER ONE SEAT'S FILE. A re-dispatched seat writes a NEW report beside its
 * superseded predecessor (the handle is in the name — see {@link panelistReportPath}), and that predecessor is
 * evidence until the run is finished with. So nothing is removed per seat, and a run directory is removed only
 * when ALL of these hold, checked in this order:
 *   1. its name is a valid run id and it is a real directory (a symlink is not followed, and not removed);
 *   2. THIS checkout's run store holds a record for it — the scratch root is WORKSPACE-level and every checkout's
 *      runs share it, while a store is per-checkout, so a directory with no record here is most likely another
 *      checkout's live committee. It is left alone, which also means a run whose record was deleted by hand
 *      (the {@link ABANDON_HINT} exit) leaves its directory behind for a person to remove;
 *   3. the record is an `explore` run holding NO `in-flight` effect entry — the one refusal that must never be
 *      wrong, since deleting a directory a running investigator is about to write into turns a slow committee
 *      into a lost one;
 *   4. the engine calls it `complete`. A run wedged on a terminal refusal is not, and keeps its reports.
 *
 * Every report's text is already on the record by then (bounded at {@link REPORT_RECORD_CHARS}), so what a
 * reclaim loses is only the tail of a report the record truncated — the reason the truncation note says the file
 * lasts until the run completes, rather than promising it forever.
 *
 * ── HOW A PANELIST IS KNOWN TO BE DONE ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `dispatch-lane`'s observer could not answer `succeeded` from liveness alone, because `claude agents` reports
 * whether a session exists and never how it ended. This operation has a better signal available and uses it:
 * the panelist's own report, ending in {@link REPORT_END_MARKER}. Three answers fall out, and each uses the
 * word that means what happened (see `we:scripts/operations/effect-observer.mjs`'s `OBSERVATIONS`):
 *
 *   | what is on disk / in the listing                     | answer       | why                              |
 *   |------------------------------------------------------|--------------|----------------------------------|
 *   | a report ending in the marker                         | `succeeded`  | the panelist finished on purpose |
 *   | a non-empty report, no marker, session GONE           | `resolved`   | it ran to a known but UNCLEAN end |
 *   | session listed (or inside the listing grace)          | `running`    | ask again later                  |
 *   | no usable report and the session is gone              | `unresolved` | a person decides                 |
 *
 * The MARKER is what makes the file axis safe to run first. Without it, an investigator that saves a draft
 * halfway would be resolved mid-thought and its partial report synthesized as if final. With it, a partial file
 * reads as still-running — and the `resolved` row is the honest exit for the panelist that died holding one.
 *
 * IMPURE by construction: `node`, `claude`, `fs`.

 * ONE PANELIST ATTEMPT'S REPORT PATH. Derived, never stored — which is what lets the SINK (which writes the
 * brief naming it) and the OBSERVER (which reads it back, in a different process, possibly days later) agree
 * without a field on the run record that could go stale. Both call this.
 *
 * ── THE HANDLE IS IN THE PATH, AND IT IS THE WHOLE SECURITY OF THE COMMITTEE (PR review, blocker 1) ──────────
 *
 * The first cut keyed the path on `(runId, panelist)` alone, and that was breakable in two ways that share one
 * root cause: the path was DERIVABLE by anything that knew the run id and the seat number.
 *
 *   - **One panelist could author the whole committee.** The executor serializes the seats, so p1 runs to
 *     completion BEFORE p2 is dispatched. Its brief hands it the absolute path of its own report, from which
 *     `p2.md` and `p3.md` are a substitution away. A panelist subverted by the untrusted material it was told
 *     to fetch could therefore pre-write both, and both would resolve `succeeded` on their first poll — while
 *     the synthesis mandate calls agreement across independent lenses *"the strongest signal this shape
 *     produces"*. The reports still travel fenced, so the juror treats them as data; what was forged is the
 *     AGREEMENT, and on a `file-stories` run forged agreement becomes real backlog items.
 *   - **A retried seat inherited its predecessor's report.** Close a seat out `failed` and the re-dispatch
 *     writes to the same path — where the previous attempt's finished report already sits, marker and all. The
 *     new investigator would be resolved on work it did not do, before it had done any.
 *
 * A MINTED `randomUUID()` closes both. The sink knows the id because it minted it; the observer knows it
 * because it is the entry's `handle` (which it already reads, and which `planObservations` guarantees is
 * present — a handle-less entry is skipped as `NO_HANDLE` and never observed at all). A retry mints a fresh
 * one, so a superseded attempt's report is addressed by a name nothing looks at any more.
 *
 * ── WHAT IT DOES **NOT** CLOSE, STATED BECAUSE THE FIRST DRAFT CLAIMED OTHERWISE (PR review r2, should-fix 1) ─
 *
 * That draft said *"nothing else can derive it"*. That is false, and a false security claim is worse than a
 * documented residual — the next reader stops looking. A sibling seat's handle is reachable through two live
 * channels, both of which need a panelist to go looking rather than to substitute one token:
 *
 *   1. **The run record sits inside the panelist's own cwd.** It is started in the checkout it investigates,
 *      and `we:scripts/operations/run-store.mjs` puts records at `<that checkout>/.operations/runs/<id>.json` —
 *      plain JSON carrying every seat's `handle`. The brief forbids reading it; an instruction is not
 *      enforcement, and nothing mechanically prevents a `cat` from an agent that was handed the checkout and
 *      told to read code and run commands.
 *   2. **`claude agents --json` set-differencing.** A panelist is not killed when its report resolves — the
 *      observer resolves off the FILE, and a session lingers. Because the executor serializes the seats,
 *      exactly one new session appears when the next one is dispatched, so a still-running panelist can
 *      attribute it with certainty.
 *
 * So the attack is raised from a one-token substitution to a multi-step read-then-write, and the retry case is
 * gone outright — but a determined subverted panelist can still forge its neighbours. The two halves of the
 * proportionate response are HERE (this note, so nobody trusts a closure that does not exist) and in the
 * brief's blindness paragraph (`we:scripts/operations/explore.mjs#buildPanelistBrief`, which now forbids
 * WRITING anywhere but the one path it was given, and forbids reading the run record and the agent listing).
 * The structural close — putting the run store outside the panelist's cwd, or not letting a reported panelist
 * keep running — changes machinery this operation does not own, and is filed (#xvpy20j) rather than improvised.

 * ── THIS IS THE ONE WRITE IN THIS FILE THAT LANDS IN A COMMITTED TREE (PR review, blocker 2) ─────────────────
 *
 * The panelist reports live at the workspace scratch root, outside every checkout (see the header). These two
 * files do not: they are tracked `src/…` paths, and the first cut wrote them with a bare `writeFileSync`. Run
 * `explore --terminal=publish-research` from the primary checkout and it would have written straight into
 * primary — which `laneGuardDecision` denies for exactly this reason, and which it never got the chance to,
 * because a CLI writing to `fs` is never seen by the `PreToolUse(Edit|Write)` hooks. That is the mechanism gap
 * `we:scripts/backlog/guarded-write.mjs`'s header names: *enforce at the SOURCE*.
 *
 * The two terminal sinks were also inconsistent about it — `defaultScaffoldItem` shells `backlog.mjs`, which
 * DOES enforce it, so filing a story from primary already refused while publishing research did not.
 *
 * THREE GATES, ALL BEFORE EITHER WRITE, ALL `notApplied`:
 *   1. `laneGuardDecision` — lane isolation (#2302/#104/#2219/#2339), the same decider `guarded-write` calls;
 *   2. `assertPublishableContent` — the #3015 secret scrub and the #883 locus-prefix scan, imported rather
 *      than re-derived. The second matters here more than it does for a hand-written card: this content is
 *      JUROR PROSE, summarizing panelists who were told to cite *"a file and line"*, and
 *      `we:scripts/check-standards.mjs` scans both of these directories. Without the gate a successful publish
 *      REDDENS THE GATE FOR WHOEVER LANDS NEXT — one instance up from the failure the "BOTH FILES, ALWAYS"
 *      note above already guards against;
 *   3. the overwrite guard — a topic id that already belongs to somebody else's research is not this run's to
 *      replace, and a silent overwrite there is unrecoverable data loss.
 *
 * All three are `notApplied` because all three run before anything is written, so all three are PROVABLY
 * nothing-landed and the entry is `failed` (retried) rather than indeterminate. A gate that keeps refusing —
 * a juror that keeps writing bare paths, a topic id already taken — retries identically until a person acts,
 * which is the same bounded-but-repeating shape `dispatch-lane-io.mjs#assertNotALaneCheckout` records: nothing
 * is ever written, and the refusal names what to fix.
 *
 * AND WHAT "A PERSON ACTS" MEANS HERE IS THINNER THAN IT SOUNDS (PR review r2, nit 5). Past the `confirm` the
 * verdict is frozen on the record, so a deterministic content refusal has no supported way out: the executor
 * refuses, `advance` returns unchanged, the waker skips the run (nothing is in-flight), and `wake --resolve`
 * accepts only an `in-flight` entry. There is no abandon-a-run surface in the engine at all — `review-pr`'s
 * `record` step shares the gap; this is just the first operation whose terminal refusal is deterministic
 * enough to hit it reliably. So the refusals below NAME the manual exit rather than leaving an operator to
 * discover there isn't one. {@link ABANDON_HINT}.
