/**
 * @file dispatch-lane.test.mjs — the effect that STARTS rather than completes (#3037, under epic #3029).
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE IS FOR. #3037's acceptance has two clauses, and the tests are grouped to match them:
 *
 *   1. **A lane is dispatched with the SAME holds and bookkeeping as the current tick.** The proof is
 *      structural, not statistical: the operation reads `decisions.spawnBuilds` and nothing else, `lane` is
 *      not an input field at all, and a `num` the core SUPPRESSED comes back as a non-dispatch carrying the
 *      guard's own reason. There is no path from a caller to a lane the core did not assign.
 *   2. **The launched agent's handle is recorded on the run.** Asserted here at the effect-entry level; the
 *      cross-process half — a second `node` that never saw the dispatch reading the handle off disk — is
 *      `./dispatch-crosses-processes.test.mjs`.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE SPAWNS AN AGENT, and that is the point of the injected `spawnAgent`: the argv is asserted
 * exactly (it is the contract with the `claude` CLI), and no `claude` process is ever started by the suite.

// verdict was always honest about not dispatching. Nothing was dispatched.
//
// EVERY CASE HERE GOES THROUGH THE REAL `readTick` AND THE REAL BRIEFS ON DISK. A stub read that hands the
// declaration a `launchKind` proves only that the declaration honours one; the whole gap was in the shell,
// between the core's three lists and the one the reader looked at. Only the spawner is stubbed.

// three (`'build' | 'prepare' | 'prepare-decision'`, stated explicitly at its own `:68`/`:131` and confirmed by
// `grep -c 'spawnFixes\|spawnCiHeals\|ciHeal\|CI-heal'` over its card returning 0). An item the planner put in
// `spawnFixes` or `spawnCiHeals` — the two kinds a `review:changes` bounce or a red/BEHIND PR need to ever get
// auto-repaired — reached `briefPath` and THREW, because it took a kind `BRIEF_BY_KIND` did not carry. This
// section proves both kinds now reach the spawner, filled with the tokens their own briefs (not the five the
// first three kinds share) actually declare.
//
// EVERY CASE HERE GOES THROUGH THE REAL `readTick` AND THE REAL BRIEFS ON DISK, same discipline as #3165's own
// block — only the spawner and the PR→ref lookup (`laneRefForPr`, which would otherwise shell `gh pr view`)
