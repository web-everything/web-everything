/**
 * @file scripts/operations/telemetry.mjs
 * @description THE DELIVERY TELEMETRY SCHEMA — the pure core of the mechanical delivery system's unified
 * trace/span/metric record (#3383). This is the *shape* half; the boundary (where it lands on disk, how a
 * line is appended and read back) lives next door in {@link ./telemetry-store.mjs} and re-exports everything
 * here, so a caller has ONE import. Same pure-core / io-shell split as `call-log.mjs`/`call-log-store.mjs`
 * and `run-record.mjs`/`run-store.mjs` — deliberately not a third convention.
 *
 * ================================================================================================
 * WHY THIS EXISTS — the gap it closes, measured before it was designed (survey, 2026-09-12).
 *
 * Five record families already capture *something* about a delivery, each keyed differently, none joinable:
 *
 *   | store                                   | keyed by         | duration? | attempt? | item? |
 *   |-----------------------------------------|------------------|-----------|----------|-------|
 *   | `.operations/runs/<runId>.json`          | `<op>-<uuid>`    | per STEP  | per EFFECT | buried in `input` |
 *   | `.operations/completions/<session>.json` | session slug     | no        | no       | yes   |
 *   | `.operations/delivery-reports/*.json`    | session slug     | no        | no       | yes   |
 *   | `.operations/calls/<day>.jsonl`          | day (append)     | no        | no       | NO    |
 *   | `.operations/fix-reports/*.json`         | session slug     | no        | no       | via PR |
 *
 * The run store's `stepTimings[]` is real per-phase timing — but it only covers work driven through the
 * DECLARED-operation engine (`registry.mjs` → `cli-adapter.mjs`). The six dispatch wrappers
 * (`deliver-item-wrapper.mjs`, `fix-dispatch-wrapper.mjs`, `prepare-scope-wrapper.mjs`,
 * `prepare-decision-wrapper.mjs`, `ci-heal-dispatch-wrapper.mjs`, `review-dispatch-wrapper.mjs`) do NOT go
 * through that engine — each hand-rolls its own sequence around `minimal-context-provider.mjs#run`. So the
 * single most expensive span in the whole system (the agent's own working turn, capped at 60 MINUTES by
 * `DELIVERY_AGENT_SPAWN_TIMEOUT_MS`) is timed by NOTHING today, and neither is lane-acquire, the gate, the
 * converge rounds, or PR-open.
 *
 * `readiness/conveyor-instrument.mjs` (#2680) already derives per-item phase math — but from `gh` PR
 * timestamps + backlog dates AFTER the fact, and it says so itself: with no dispatch stamp its `authoring`
 * phase is `{ms: null, reason: 'no-dispatch-signal'}` and the aggregate flags `needsDispatchInstrumentation`.
 * Its `mark-dispatch`/`mark-setup` capture verbs are confirmed DEAD (no call site, no sidecar on disk, per
 * `we:backlog/3569-*`). This file is the FIRST-PARTY capture that instrument was always missing — it does not
 * replace the instrument's derivation, it supplies the boundary stamps the derivation asks for.
 * ================================================================================================
 *
 * WHAT IT BORROWS FROM OPENTELEMETRY, AND WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT.
 *
 * BORROWED (portable ideas, no SDK, no dependency, no collector):
 *   • TRACE / SPAN / PARENT. One backlog item's whole delivery lifecycle = one trace; each phase = a span
 *     with `startedAt`/`endedAt`/`durationMs`/`status`, nested via `parentSpanId`.
 *   • THREE STATUS CODES, exactly OTel's: `unset` / `ok` / `error` ({@link SPAN_STATUS}). Not four, not a
 *     bespoke per-wrapper vocabulary. A wrapper's own richer outcome word (`blocked-on-infra`, `gate-red`,
 *     `bounced`) rides in `statusMessage` + `attributes`, never in `status` — that is exactly the
 *     `status` / `status_message` split OTel draws, and it is what lets an error RATE be computed across
 *     six wrappers that will never agree on outcome vocabulary.
 *   • LOW-CARDINALITY SPAN NAMES ({@link SPAN_NAMES}), high-cardinality detail in `attributes`. `lane.acquire`
 *     is a span name; `lane-19` is an attribute. This is the single semconv rule that makes aggregation work,
 *     and the closed set is ENFORCED ({@link validateSpanEnd}) so a sixth wrapper cannot quietly mint
 *     `acquireLaneForReviewLoop` and fall out of every rollup.
 *   • RESOURCE ATTRIBUTES — the "who/where produced this" bag that is identical for every span in a process
 *     (repo, branch, commit sha, host, pid, runner id). Stamped once per recorder, not retyped per span.
 *   • METRICS AS A SEPARATE SIGNAL from spans, sharing one transport ({@link EVENT_TYPES}).
 *
 * NOT BORROWED, on purpose:
 *   • No OTel SDK / collector / OTLP exporter. This is a CLI-driven, file-based, short-lived-process system;
 *     a batching exporter with a shutdown flush is the wrong shape for a process that may be `SIGKILL`ed, and
 *     a runtime dependency in the driver's critical path is exactly what the watchdog discipline forbids.
 *   • No W3C `traceparent` propagation header. Nothing here crosses a network hop; the trace id is DERIVED
 *     from the work's own stable identity ({@link deriveTraceId}) rather than propagated, so two processes
 *     that never talk (a build wrapper and, three hours later, a review wrapper) land in the SAME trace
 *     without either having to pass anything to the other. This is the one place a local file-based system
 *     can do something a distributed tracer cannot, and it is the whole reason a lifecycle trace is possible
 *     here at all.
 *   • No sampling. Delivery volume is single-digit-per-hour; sampling would only lose data.
 *
 * WHY THE TRACE ID IS THE ITEM AND THE ATTEMPT IS AN ATTRIBUTE. The obvious alternative — folding the attempt
 * into the trace id — would make attempt 1 and attempt 2 of item #3441 two unrelated traces, and "how many
 * attempts did this item take" would become unanswerable from the trace alone. Keeping the attempt as a span
 * ATTRIBUTE is strictly more information: a reader may still split by attempt, and may additionally ask the
 * retry question. See {@link deriveTraceId}.
 *
 * PURE. No fs, no clock, no process, no randomness, no network, no child_process. Every input is passed in.
 * A caller that needs a clock or an id generator injects one — which is also what makes every function here
 * unit-testable against plain objects with zero disk.
 * (The one sibling import, `command-redact.mjs`, is itself pure — no fs/clock/process — so the claim holds.)

 *   • `not-applicable` / `not-ready` are NOT errors — correctly declining work that should not be done is the
 *     system working. They close `unset`, the OTel status for "ran, no verdict asserted".
 *   • `blocked-on-infra`, `gate-red`, `gate-blocked`, `blocked-mid-build`, and both `escalated-*` ARE errors —
 *     in each, a dispatch consumed a lane and an agent turn and produced no landable diff.

 *   • TRAFFIC   — dispatch volume: root spans per kind, distinct traces, spans total.
 *   • ERRORS    — `status === 'error'` RATE per span name and per kind, WITH the classified reason
 *                 (`statusMessage`) counted, so "12% of fix dispatches fail" is immediately followed by "and

 *                 today's fix-report store already gives and is not enough to act on.
 *   • SATURATION— gauge summaries per metric name (min/max/mean/last) plus the admission ledger
 *                 (admitted vs denied, with denial reasons), which is the signal the running system produces
 *                 today and persists nowhere.
 *

 *   • RETRIES   — attempts per span name (`maxAttempt`, how many spans ran at attempt > 1). Uniform across
 *                 every kind, which is precisely what today's per-store attempt bookkeeping is not.

/**
 * PURE. THE REPORTING/QUERY LAYER — reads back the individual `host.process.entry.*` samples
 * `host-process-sample.mjs#processSnapshotMetrics` wrote (paired `cpu_pct`/`mem_bytes` metric lines sharing one
 * tick + pid) and decides, per sample, whether it clears the "substantial" bar. This is the split the operator
 * asked for explicitly: collection just stores identity; THIS function is where "does this deserve its own
 * named entry" is actually decided, and it can be re-decided at any time — raise or lower `cpuThresholdPct`/
 * `memThresholdBytes` and re-run this over the SAME stored events, no re-collection needed.
 *
 * THE ONE HARD LIMIT, stated rather than hidden: a threshold LOWER than the collection-time storage floor
 * cannot recover detail that plain never got written — an `host.process.entry.*` sample only exists for a
 * process that already cleared `host-process-sample.mjs`'s own floor on the tick it was sampled. Passing a
 * looser threshold here just means everything already stored qualifies as substantial (the below-threshold
 * remainder this function computes will be empty save for whatever `host.process.below_floor_remainder.*`
 * already folded in at collection time — see below). A STRICTER threshold works exactly as advertised: some
 * already-stored rows move from "substantial" into this function's own remainder.
 *
 * GROUPED BY `command` (not `pid`) for the "substantial" bucket — a PID is a single tick's OS-assigned number
 * and is meaningless to roll up ACROSS ticks (a restarted helper gets a new one); the full command line is the
 * stable identity across the window, matching how `host-process-sample.mjs`'s own fixed-category matchers
 * already key on command, not pid. `pids` on each group lists every distinct pid observed, so "one process that
 * restarted 3 times" is still distinguishable from "3 processes running concurrently" if a reader needs that.
 * The label is the command line passed through `command-redact.mjs#redactCommandLine` again at READ time, so
 * lines stored before redaction existed (or by a caller that skipped it) are still masked in any report.
 *
 * THE MEAN IS WINDOW-NORMALISED, PER TICK (the arithmetic that makes the report reconcile with the machine).
 * A row only exists for a tick where its process cleared the storage floor, and several rows can share one
 * command on one tick (N Electron helpers with an identical command line, each its own pid). So, per group:
 *   1. rows are SUMMED per tick — N concurrent same-command processes contribute their combined load, not
 *      an average of them;
 *   2. that per-tick sum is divided by `windowTicks`, the count of DISTINCT ticks in the window that recorded
 *      any `host.process.*` sample — a tick where the group was absent counts as zero, not as "no data".
 * The same divisor is applied to `belowThresholdRemainder`. Per tick the machine is exactly
 * `fixed categories + substantial entries + below-floor remainder`, so the mean of each part over the SAME
 * `windowTicks` sums to the mean of the whole — the report's total is a true window mean, comparable to
 * `host.cpu.load1`. A tick is identified by its `tick` attribute; the runner restarts numbering at 0, so a
 * number LOWER than the previous one (in event order) starts a new run and is counted as a new tick, not
 * merged with the earlier run's. A sample with no `tick` attribute falls back to its `timestamp`.
 *
 * THE REMAINDER STAYS HONEST: `belowThresholdRemainder` sums, per tick, BOTH (a) any stored `entry` row this
 * function's own threshold judged not substantial, and (b) that tick's `host.process.below_floor_remainder.*`
 * sample (the collection-time floor's own remainder) — BEFORE averaging, so a stricter threshold never mixes a
 * single process row into a mean with a whole tick's aggregate. `substantial` entries + `belowThresholdRemainder`
 * + the three fixed categories (already reported by `goldenSignals`'s `saturation.gauges`, untouched by this
 * function) therefore still account for the whole machine, the same honesty invariant the original `other`
 * bucket existed to uphold. Any process that was substantial on some ticks and merely below-floor on others
 * has the latter ticks in the remainder — never lost, never double counted.
 * @param {object[]} events already-read telemetry events (see `telemetry-store.mjs#readAll`/`readDay`)
 * @param {{cpuThresholdPct?: number, memThresholdBytes?: number}} [opts]
 * @returns {{substantial: Array<{label: string, pids: number[], meanCpuPct: number, meanMemBytes: number,
 *   maxCpuPct: number, maxMemBytes: number, samples: number}>,
 *   belowThresholdRemainder: {meanCpuPct: number, meanMemBytes: number, samples: number},
 *   windowTicks: number, cpuThresholdPct: number, memThresholdBytes: number}}
 *   `samples` on a group / the remainder is the number of DISTINCT TICKS it appeared in (out of `windowTicks`);
 *   `maxCpuPct`/`maxMemBytes` are the peak PER-TICK sum for the group.
