/**
 * @file scripts/readiness/queue-report.mjs
 * @description The single, DECLARED, MECHANICAL classification of the conveyor's held queue (WE #x85oow9). A
 *   hand-produced `/wip` status report (2026-09-06) misclassified a scope-overlap hold (`overlaps lane-<n>`,
 *   `no free lane`) as "not queued" when it is actually a genuine queue member simply waiting its turn for a
 *   lane to free up — a mistake that happened precisely because this classification was re-derived by hand/prose
 *   every time it was needed. This script closes that gap: ONE tested function maps every token of
 *   {@link ../readiness/dispatch-plan.mjs dispatch-plan.mjs}'s `HELD_REASONS` into exactly one of three buckets,
 *   so no caller ever re-derives the mapping.
 *
 *   • `queued-waiting-turn` — a REAL queue member, just waiting on capacity/turn. Nothing to do but wait:
 *     `overlaps lane-<n>` (a running lane, or a higher-ranked rival, owns the same scope), `no free lane`
 *     (every lane is busy), `capacity-cap` (#xupukxa — a free lane exists, but the concurrent-lane ceiling
 *     withheld it), and `dispatch-paused` (#3609 — the item is otherwise launchable; a manual operator
 *     kill-switch is withholding it, cleared via `dispatch-pause.mjs clear`). This is the exact bucket tonight's
 *     mistake put in the wrong place.
 *   • `not-ready` — needs an action (or an external event) before it can ever be picked up, independent of lane
 *     capacity: `blocked`, `unshaped-no-scope`, `needs-prepare`, `needs-slice`, `needs-decision`,
 *     `needs-investigation`, `branch-drift-blocked`, `cleared-but-not-ready`.
 *   • `stale-noise` — not a real held queue member at all; a signal that something should be verified/cleared,
 *     never waited on: `already-done` (a merged PR appears to already close the item out).
 *
 * PURE-CORE / IO-SHELL SPLIT (mirrors dispatch-plan.mjs / conveyor-state.mjs — NOT the heavier
 *   `we:scripts/operations/*.mjs` + `run.mjs` declared-operation DSL, which exists for MULTI-STEP operations
 *   with a judge/confirm step; this has no judgment step at all, it is a pure data compose):
 *   • The PURE core ({@link classifyHeld}, {@link buildQueueReport}) has NO fs / git / clock / child_process —
 *     every input (the dispatch-plan `held`/`launch` output, the conveyor-state `lanes`/`unshaped`/`needsSlice`/
 *     `decisions` sections, and a `byNum` title map) is passed IN. Directly unit-tested with plain objects.
 *   • The IO SHELL (`main()`, gated on the main-module check) resolves which checkout the LIVE conveyor runner
 *     is rooted in ({@link ../conveyor/resolve-runner-checkout.mjs resolveRunnerCheckout}) — falling back to the
 *     local cwd, with a logged reason, when no runner is resolved — then shells `dispatch-plan.mjs --json` and
 *     `conveyor-state.mjs --json` IN THAT CHECKOUT (composing the existing single-sourced reads, never
 *     re-deriving queue/lease/lane state), loads the backlog title map via the SAME
 *     `require(src/_data/backlog.js)` → `byNum` idiom `dispatch-plan.mjs` and `conveyor-state.mjs` already each
 *     use (no separate bulk-title resolver exists in this repo; this follows the established idiom rather than
 *     inventing a fourth), and emits the composed report.
 *
 * `active.fixing` / `active.healing` are always `null` ("unavailable"), NEVER a fabricated `0`: a real count
 * needs the conveyor runner's own live, in-process guard bookkeeping (`we:scripts/conveyor/tick-core.mjs`'s
 * `computeTickCounts` — `liveFixGuards` / `liveCiHealGuards`), which is carried tick-to-tick inside
 * `we:skills-src/conveyor/runner.mjs`'s own process and is NEVER persisted to a file an external reader could
 * see cold. Guessing it from PR labels would be exactly the kind of prose-classification mistake this script
 * exists to replace. This mirrors `conveyor-state.mjs`'s own `shapeDaemon` "unavailable" graceful-degrade
 * pattern — an honest absence, not a wrong number.
 *
 * `active.preparing` is a NAMED APPROXIMATION, not a live-in-progress confirmation: it lists every armed
 * (cleared-for-build) item the dispatcher would hold `unshaped-no-scope` / `needs-slice` / `needs-decision` /
 * `needs-investigation` —
 * i.e. an auto-prepare CANDIDATE, not proof an agent is preparing it THIS instant (that too is live guard
 * bookkeeping this script cannot see). Each entry carries its `reason` so a reader is never misled into reading
 * it as ground truth.
