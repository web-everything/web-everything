/**
 * @file scripts/readiness/dispatch-plan.mjs
 * @description The DETERMINISTIC DISPATCHER core of the conveyor (WE #x53zzf9, epic #xkggoo0). Given the build
 *   queue, the active scope leases, and the free lane slots, it decides — as JSON — what LAUNCHES where and what
 *   HOLDS (and why). This is the keystone the future product conveyor inherits: plateau's server will shell it
 *   exactly like its `/api/scope-lease` endpoint shells {@link ./scope-lease-collect.mjs} today (one
 *   implementation, two shells), per the statute
 *   [we:docs/agent/platform-decisions.md#deterministic-core-thin-judgment].
 *
 * PURE-CORE / IO-SHELL SPLIT (the hard design constraint, mirrored from the sibling scope-lease modules):
 *   • The PURE core ({@link dispatchPlan}) has NO fs / git / clock / child_process — the queue, the leases, and
 *     the free-lane list are all passed IN. It is unit-tested directly (scripts/readiness/__tests__/
 *     dispatch-plan.test.mjs) with plain objects, no git/network. It NEVER re-implements scope-overlap
 *     detection: it composes {@link ./scope-lease.mjs scopesOverlap} — the same prefix-aware intersection the
 *     scope-lease board and collector use.
 *   • The IO SHELL (the `main()` CLI, gated on the main-module check) gathers the three inputs by shelling the
 *     existing readiness scripts — {@link ../backlog.mjs backlog.mjs build-queue --json} for the ranked build
 *     queue, {@link ./scope-lease-collect.mjs scope-lease-collect --json} for the live leases, and
 *     {@link ../lane-pool.mjs lane-pool list --acquirable --json} for the free lanes — then calls the pure
 *     core and emits its plan. REUSE, never reinvent: the ordering engine, the scope collector, and the pool
 *     picker are each single-sourced; this shell only glues them.
 *
 * THE DISPATCH RULES (§ conveyor dispatcher). ONE pass over the queue in rank order (highest-priority first).
 * Each queued item resolves to exactly ONE outcome:
 *
 *   • openBlockers > 0                              → held "blocked"           (an unready item can't launch).
 *   • kind:epic / kind:feature (grouping kinds)      → held "needs-slice"       (a container — /slice it, never build; see below).
 *   • kind:decision                                 → held "needs-decision"    (not a build — prepare/present it; see below).
 *   • no usable scope (absent / non-array / [])     → held "unshaped-no-scope" (NEVER launched to build — see below).
 *   • scope intersects an ACTIVE lease's scope      → held "overlaps lane-<n>" (a running lane owns those paths).
 *   • scope intersects a HIGHER-RANKED item WE JUST  → held "overlaps lane-<n>" (the rival pair: the higher-ranked
 *     LAUNCHED this same tick (a rival pair)           of two mutually-overlapping queued items launches; the
 *                                                       lower-ranked one holds on the lane it was assigned).
 *   • otherwise (disjoint) — assign the next free   → launch { num, lane }     (rank order fills free lanes until
 *     lane; once the free lanes run out              the slots run out).
 *                                                    → held "no free lane"      (disjoint but nowhere to run).
 *                                                    → held "capacity-cap"      (disjoint, a free lane physically
 *                                                       exists, but launching it would exceed `maxConcurrentLanes`
 *                                                       — see below; a DIFFERENT reason from "no free lane" on
 *                                                       purpose, since the fix differs: raise the cap or wait, vs.
 *                                                       free a lane).
 *
 * CONCURRENCY CEILING (#xupukxa, live incident 2026-09-07 — freeing one lane cascaded into 42 concurrent lane
 * dispatches, 1-min load average 34.95 on a 12-core host). `maxConcurrentLanes` (default from
 * {@link ../lib/lane-concurrency.mjs resolveMaxConcurrentLanes}, `WE_MAX_CONCURRENT_LANES` env-overridable) caps
 * `freeLanes` against the ALREADY-ACTIVE lease count via {@link ../lib/lane-concurrency.mjs capToConcurrency}
 * BEFORE any assignment: `room = maxConcurrentLanes - leases.length`, so this dispatcher's OWN build launches
 * never alone exceed the ceiling. A SEPARATE, new admission point from
 * {@link ./heavy-admission.mjs} (#3461/#3456) — that caps concurrent HEAVY COMMANDS running INSIDE an
 * already-dispatched lane, never whether a lane is dispatched at all; this caps lane dispatch itself, upstream
 * of heavy-admission entirely. `tick-core.mjs#planTick` applies the SAME shared cap to its OWN
 * prepare/fix/ci-heal spawns (against `leases.length` PLUS this tick's admitted build launches), so the two
 * independent lane-consuming decisions share one budget rather than each maxing out the free-lane pool alone —
 * see its own header for that half. Defaults to unlimited (`Infinity`) when omitted, so every existing direct
 * caller of the pure core (tests included) keeps its prior unrestricted behavior unless it opts in.
 *
 * AUTO-PREPARE, NOT A SERIAL FLOOR (the corrected design, ruled 2026-07-22 — Nicolas). An UNSCOPED item (scope
 * ABSENT or EMPTY `[]`) is NEVER dispatched to build — not even alone into an idle pool. Building blind is exactly
 * the hazard the old "serial floor" reintroduced: the conveyor would build an item at the same moment it needed
 * scope authored for it, and an unscoped build is "assume-overlaps-everything" (it might touch ANY file). So the
 * dispatcher HOLDS every unscoped item `unshaped-no-scope` — always, even when the pool is fully idle and lanes
 * are free. That is the point: the /conveyor SKILL sees the held item (here and in `state.unshaped`) and dispatches
 * a lightweight PREPARE-SCOPE task that authors the item's `scope:` frontmatter; once that lands the item is scoped
 * and dispatches to BUILD on a later tick. Net effect: unscoped cleared item → auto-prepare (add scope) → then
 * build. The conveyor never builds without scope and never dispatches blind. An EMPTY scope reads identically to
 * absent — it is NOT a meaningful "touches nothing" build (every built item produces a lane diff), and this keeps
 * the pure core aligned with the loader (normalizeScope collapses [] → undefined) and check:standards (which ERRORS
 * on an empty scope). The operator gloss is UNSHAPED_HINT — "no predicted scope — author it to parallelize".
 * Precedence is exactly the listed order: a blocked item is blocked even with no scope; an unscoped item holds even
 * when a free lane exists; a lease/rival overlap holds a scoped item even when a free lane exists.
 *
 * Predicted `scope:` is authored UPSTREAM at readiness (prepare/shape time or the auto-prepare task above); the
 * dispatcher only READS it — it never probes for scope at dispatch and never launches an unscoped item to build
 * (scope authored at readiness; we:docs/agent/platform-decisions.md#state-lives-where-its-nature-dictates — being
 * codified in a sibling statute PR).

// ── PURE CORE (no fs / git / clock / child_process — every input is injected) ─────────────────────────────────

/** The held-reason vocabulary the plan emits (the exact `reason` set #x53zzf9 specifies). `cleared-but-not-ready`
 *  is SHELL-emitted (#2613 review, required 2b): a sidecar id with no ready build-queue row — surfaced as a held
 *  entry so a clear never silently vanishes. The pure {@link dispatchPlan} itself never emits it (those items are
 *  not in its `queue` input); the IO shell appends them via {@link clearedNotReady}.
 *
 *  `unshaped-no-scope` (#2613 auto-prepare, ruled 2026-07-22): an item with no predicted `scope` is treated as
 *  "assume-overlaps-everything" and is NEVER launched to build — it is ALWAYS HELD `unshaped-no-scope` (even in a
 *  fully-idle pool with free lanes) and surfaced so the /conveyor skill auto-prepares its `scope:` upstream; once
 *  that lands the item is scoped and dispatches to BUILD. The operator gloss is fixed — "no predicted scope —
 *  author it to parallelize" ({@link UNSHAPED_HINT}); the reason TOKEN stays short for stable matching.
 *
 *  `needs-slice` (#2645): a cleared `kind:epic`. An epic is a CONTAINER — its work lives in child stories/tasks,
 *  so it is NEVER directly buildable and must never be launched to build (nor auto-prepared for scope, which would
 *  aim a build agent at a container). The dispatcher HOLDS every cleared epic `needs-slice` — a FIRST-CLASS
 *  outcome, not a silent skip — so the /conveyor skill surfaces it for `/slice` (decompose into buildable child
 *  stories, which dispatch on later ticks). A cleared epic is a slice TRIGGER, not a dead end; the operator gloss
 *  is {@link NEEDS_SLICE_HINT}.
 *
 *  `needs-decision` (#2647): a cleared `kind:decision`. A decision is NOT build work — its lifecycle is
 *  prepare (research + author its forks to "ready to ratify", the /prepare skill's autonomous half) then present
 *  (surface the prepared forks for a human to ratify). A decision has no `scope:`, so — exactly like the epic
 *  case — it is held BEFORE the scope gate so it is not mislabeled `unshaped-no-scope` and aimed at a scope-
 *  prediction agent (which authors a build touch-set, meaningless for a decision). The dispatcher HOLDS every
 *  cleared decision `needs-decision` — a FIRST-CLASS outcome — so the /conveyor skill drives it per its prepared
 *  state (`state.decisions[].prepared`): UNPREPARED → spawn a prepare-decision agent; PREPARED → present its forks
 *  (artefact + the ruling surface) for ratification. The operator gloss is {@link NEEDS_DECISION_HINT}.
 *
 *  `needs-investigation` (#3567): a cleared `kind:investigation`. An investigation is NOT build work either —
 *  it is a single dispatched investigator (investigate -> synthesize -> report, optionally filing children),
 *  never a two-phase prepare/present lifecycle the way a decision is. It has no `scope:`, so — same reason as
 *  the decision case just above — it is held BEFORE the scope gate rather than mislabeled `unshaped-no-scope`.
 *  UNLIKE a decision, there is no `prepared` flag to wait on: `we:scripts/conveyor/tick-core.mjs`'s `planTick`
 *  spawns every `needs-investigation` hold directly (`spawnInvestigations`) the same tick it clears. The
 *  operator gloss is {@link NEEDS_INVESTIGATION_HINT}.
 *
 *  `already-done` (#3457/#3460): a queued item the IO shell's AGE-GATED ground-truth enrichment found a real
 *  merged PR already closing out (Fork 2(b) of #3457's ratified ruling). Checked FIRST, ahead of every other
 *  branch — see {@link dispatchPlan}'s own step 0 for why a real PR-history signal outranks a stale `blocked` /
 *  `needs-slice` / `needs-decision` / scope read, all of which are themselves derived from the same possibly-
 *  stale `status:`/frontmatter this check exists to stop trusting blind. HOLDS, never auto-resolves — the shell
 *  never mutates the item's frontmatter on this item's own say-so (see `filterAlreadyDoneCandidates`'s docblock
 *  in `we:scripts/operations/dispatch-lane-io.mjs` for the false-positive residual this leaves recoverable). The
 *  operator gloss is {@link ALREADY_DONE_HINT}.
 *
 *  `branch-drift-blocked` (#3464): a queued item whose scope overlaps a long-lived dispatched-work branch's
 *  (e.g. `lane/mechanical-dispatcher`) own unreconciled, blocked drift — `we:scripts/conveyor/branch-drift.mjs`'s
 *  latest `check` verdict is `blocked` (a dry-run merge conflicts, or the branch sits past its reconciliation
 *  ceiling) AND this item's scope overlaps the drifting branch's own live scope. This is the concrete guard
 *  #3464's incident named: two independently-scoped, individually-correct dispatch streams (this pool's `main`
 *  dispatch, and the branch's own out-of-band one) piling MORE changes onto the same hot files while nothing
 *  reconciles them, until the eventual merge becomes unresolvable. HOLDS — it never auto-reconciles the branch;
 *  it only pauses NEW same-scope dispatch until a fresh sweep clears it. The operator gloss is
 *  {@link BRANCH_DRIFT_BLOCKED_HINT}. A GRADUATION SLICE is exempt (#3836, statute
 *  `we:docs/agent/platform-decisions.md#poc-branch-mechanical-sync` point 4): an item whose `parent` is the
 *  drifting branch's registered `graduationItem` (`we:scripts/lib/poc-branches.json`) lands on `main` in its own
 *  PR, porting files as diffs onto `main`'s current tree, so it never piles onto the unreconciled branch.
 *
 *  `dispatch-paused` (#3609): a MANUAL/EMERGENCY kill-switch, distinct from every reason above — those are all
 *  properties of the ITEM (its own readiness, scope, or a scope conflict); this is a deliberate OPERATOR
 *  override that holds every item that would otherwise have launched, regardless of what it is or what scope it
 *  touches. Set/cleared via `we:scripts/readiness/dispatch-pause.mjs` (`set|clear|status`); checked last, only
 *  at the point an item would actually be assigned a lane — an item held for any OTHER reason (blocked,
 *  needs-slice, needs-decision, unshaped-no-scope, an overlap, already-done, branch-drift-blocked) keeps that
 *  more specific reason, since the pause changes nothing about why THAT item wasn't launching anyway. Never
 *  touches an already-running lane — this pure core has no lease/lane-release knowledge at all. The operator
 *  gloss is {@link DISPATCH_PAUSED_HINT}.
 *
 *  `pr-limit` (we:xniq7xs, parent #4075): too many open PRs is usually a REVIEW-SYSTEM problem (the drain/
 *  review pipeline can't keep up), not a build problem, so opening ANOTHER new PR makes that backlog worse.
 *  Checked at the SAME point as `dispatch-paused` (an item otherwise launchable) — the IO shell resolves the
 *  live open-PR count/limit/override state (`we:scripts/lib/pr-limit.mjs`) and hands this core a plain
 *  boolean, same as `dispatchPaused`. An item whose predicted `scope:` is entirely conveyor/daemon
 *  infrastructure (`isExemptChangeset`) is exempt — the fix for an overloaded review system must always get
 *  through. This gate governs ONLY the "open a brand-new PR" queue this core schedules — a `fix`/`ci-heal`
 *  spawn against an ALREADY-OPEN PR is a separate pass entirely (`we:scripts/conveyor/tick-core.mjs`'s
 *  `planFixSpawns`/CI-heal sibling), which this function never touches, so it is never held by this. The
 *  operator gloss is {@link PR_LIMIT_HINT}. */

 * }} input
 *   • `queue`     — the build queue ALREADY IN RANK ORDER (highest-priority first): the `buildQueued` items.
 *                   Each carries its `kind` (so a `kind:epic` container is held `needs-slice` and a `kind:decision`
 *                   is held `needs-decision` — neither is ever built), its
 *                   predicted `scope` (repo-relative path prefixes, comparable to the leases' scopes), its
 *                   `openBlockers`, and its `alreadyDonePr` (#3457/#3460 — the AGE-GATED ground-truth
 *                   enrichment's evidence, or `null`/absent when not checked or nothing found; see
 *                   `we:scripts/operations/dispatch-lane-io.mjs#filterAlreadyDoneCandidates` for the query and
 *                   `isStaleEnoughForGroundTruth` for the age gate). The pure core does NOT re-order — the
 *                   ordering engine ({@link ../lib/build-queue.mjs orderQueueDetailed}) owns rank; this
 *                   consumes that order.
 *   • `leases`    — the ACTIVE scope leases (running lanes): `{ lane, scope }`. `scope` is the lane's held
 *                   file-scope (predicted ∪ observed, from {@link ./scope-lease-collect.mjs}).
 *   • `freeLanes` — the free lane slots, as an array of lane IDS to assign (from `lane-pool list --acquirable`).
 *                   The "free lane-slot COUNT" the spec names is exactly `freeLanes.length`; the ids let a
 *                   launch carry the concrete `lane` it lands on. (Ids, not a bare count, because the plan's
 *                   `launch` must name a real lane — the same lane ids the "overlaps lane-<n>" holds reference.)
 *   • `driftBlockedScope` — (#3464) the drifting scope of a long-lived dispatched-work branch currently
 *                   `blocked` (a dry-run merge conflict, or past its reconciliation ceiling), or `null`/absent
 *                   when no branch is currently blocked (the common case, and the fail-open default when the
 *                   IO shell's drift check itself fails). A scoped item overlapping this holds
 *                   `branch-drift-blocked`, checked ahead of the lease/rival overlap gates — see
 *                   {@link BRANCH_DRIFT_BLOCKED_HINT}.
 *   • `driftGraduationItem` — (#3836) the drifting branch's registered `graduationItem` (e.g. `"3443"`), or
 *                   `null`/absent when none is registered. A queued item whose `parent` equals it is a
 *                   GRADUATION SLICE and is exempt from the `branch-drift-blocked` hold (statute
 *                   `#poc-branch-mechanical-sync` point 4); absent, nothing is exempt.
 *   • `maxConcurrentLanes` — (#xupukxa) the global lane-dispatch concurrency ceiling; `freeLanes` is trimmed
 *                   against `leases.length` via {@link ../lib/lane-concurrency.mjs capToConcurrency} before any
 *                   assignment. Defaults to `Infinity` (unlimited — today's pre-#xupukxa behavior) when
 *                   omitted; the IO shell resolves a real default via
 *                   {@link ../lib/lane-concurrency.mjs resolveMaxConcurrentLanes}. An item that would otherwise
 *                   launch but is trimmed away by this holds `capacity-cap`, distinct from `no free lane`.
 *   • `dispatchPaused` — (#3609) the MANUAL/EMERGENCY dispatch-pause lever's current state
 *                   (`we:scripts/readiness/dispatch-pause.mjs#isDispatchPaused`). When true, every item that
 *                   would otherwise be assigned a lane holds `dispatch-paused` instead — checked at the very
 *                   last step, so it never relabels an item already held for a MORE specific reason. Defaults
 *                   to `false` (unpaused — today's pre-#3609 behavior) when omitted.
 *   • `dispatchPausedKinds` — (epic #3383) the pause's optional KIND SCOPE
 *                   (`we:scripts/readiness/dispatch-pause.mjs`'s `pausedKinds` field, read by the IO shell).
 *                   `null`/absent = BLANKET, so a caller passing only `dispatchPaused: true` — every caller
 *                   written before the scope existed, and every old-format marker — still holds builds exactly
 *                   as before. A NON-EMPTY scope holds builds only when it names `build`: a pause scoped to
 *                   `fix`/`ci-heal` alone leaves this core's launches untouched, since `build` is the ONLY
 *                   kind it plans (the other five are `tick-core.mjs#planTick`'s spawns).
 *   • `sizePolicy` — (#3801 Fork 4 (b), #3849 admission) the checked-in `we:scripts/lib/dispatch-size-policy.json`
 *                   setting, ALREADY VALIDATED by the IO shell (`validateSizePolicy` in
 *                   `we:scripts/lib/dispatch-contracts.mjs` — kept OUT of this pure core's own imports, since it
 *                   transitively reaches `node:fs` via `provider-routing.mjs`). `null`/absent (the default) skips
 *                   the size gate ENTIRELY — today's pre-#3849 behavior, unlimited/unrestricted, so every existing
 *                   direct caller of the pure core (tests included) keeps dispatching an unsized item exactly as
 *                   before unless it opts in — same "off unless supplied" default as `maxConcurrentLanes`/
 *                   `dispatchPaused`. When supplied with `unsizedCardPolicy: 'block'`, a scoped `build` item (any
 *                   `kind` other than `fix`/`ci-heal`, which take the separate `fixSizeSource` chain and are never
 *                   held here) with no declared size — a story's `size:` absent, or a task's `estimatedLoc:`
 *                   absent/invalid — holds `no-size` instead of launching, checked right after the scope gate (a
 *                   READINESS gate, not a lane-scheduling concern, same precedence class as `unshaped-no-scope`).
 *                   Any OTHER `unsizedCardPolicy` (`default-size`) never holds on this axis — the item is admitted
 *                   normally and its `launch` entry carries `sized: <boolean>` (only ever added when `sizePolicy`
 *                   is supplied) so an assumed-size launch is never indistinguishable from a declared one. A
 *                   `deliveryAgent:` marker never bypasses this hold (#3801 Fork 5) — this core reads no such
 *                   field, so there is nothing to bypass.
 *   • `preparePolicy` — (card #4470, operator rule 2026-09-28: PREPARE = full design + explicit MVP cut, build
 *                   only the MVP) `null`/absent (the default) skips this gate ENTIRELY — every existing direct
 *                   caller of the pure core (tests included) keeps dispatching an unprepared item exactly as
 *                   before, unless it opts in, the SAME "off unless supplied" default `sizePolicy` uses. The IO
 *                   shell's `main()` opts in unconditionally (`{ requirePreparedDate: true }`) for the live
 *                   daemon, skippable via `--no-prepare-check` (mirrors `--no-size-check`). When supplied with
 *                   `requirePreparedDate: true`, a scoped item (any `kind` other than `fix`/`ci-heal`, exempt for
 *                   the same reason they are exempt from the size gate — neither can reach this queue via the
 *                   production build-queue shell) with no truthful `preparedDate` (a valid `YYYY-MM-DD` string;
 *                   absent/blank/malformed all read as unprepared) holds `needs-prepare` instead of launching,
 *                   checked right after the `no-size` gate (itself right after the scope gate) — same
 *                   precedence class: a READINESS gate, not a lane-scheduling concern. `preparedDate` is a
 *                   FORMAT check on self-attested frontmatter, not a verified/signed claim — it proves the field
 *                   is well-formed, never that a real prepare pass happened. This is a card lacking DoR
 *                   (Definition of Ready), never "not sized yet" (that is `no-size`'s own, separate axis).
 * @returns {{ launch: Array<{num, lane, sized?:boolean}>, held: Array<{num, reason:string}> }}
 *   `launch` — the SCOPED items to start now, each on the free lane it was assigned, in rank order. An UNSCOPED
 *              item is NEVER launched (it is held `unshaped-no-scope` for the skill to auto-prepare). `sized` is
 *              present only when `sizePolicy` was supplied — `true` when the item declared its own size/estimate,
 *              `false` when it launched on the `default-size` fallback.
