/**
 * `restamp` (#x5e2ldj) — CARRY an acceptance across a head the drain itself moved.
 *
 * THE LOOP IT ENDS, measured on PR #1445 on 2026-08-19: a clearance landed at 13:06:48 and the drain rebased
 * that lane onto the newly-merged main a minute later. The rebase is content-preserving, but a rebase onto a
 * moved base can change the context-RUN LENGTHS the contribution digest keeps, so the markers went stale and
 * `review:human` was re-parked — on the PR the drain was itself about to land. Clear, rebase, re-park, repeat.
 *
 * `we:scripts/lib/review-escalation.mjs` names this fix in its POSITION section: the drain KNOWS it produced
 * the rebase, so it can re-stamp rather than leave a gate to re-derive what it already knew.
 *
 * WHAT MAKES IT SAFE IS EVERY WAY IT REFUSES. It moves no label; it can only ever carry an acceptance that is
 * already live. The tests below are mostly refusals for that reason — a `restamp` that could CREATE an
 * acceptance would be a strictly worse `accepted`: one that skips INVARIANT 2, skips #2844's independence
 * check, and claims a review nobody ran.
