/**
 * review-set-label.mjs — swap a PR's review label, INVARIANT-2 guarded (#2470, increment 2 of 2). Also the
 * SINGLE HOME of the shared review-label CLI harness (#2644): a PURE `decideSetLabel` decides the swap for a
 * reviewer verdict (`accepted` / `changes`) OR the fix-agent re-arm (`rearm`), and a thin `runReviewLabelCli`
 * does the `gh` observe→write→re-read arc (the two writes are the comment and the label swap; which one goes
 * first is decided per-PR by the #2964 ordering rule — see `runReviewLabelCli`). The conveyor's
 * `rearm-review.mjs` is now a THIN shim over
 * both (it used to clone this file byte-for-byte). Single-sourced in WE (Native-First / zero standard-impl here
 * — this is a definition + write tool, not product code) so the plateau console and the conveyor fix agent both
 * shell/import it rather than re-implementing how a label swap lands.
 *
 * #2844 — INVARIANT 2 says a `review:human` PR may not be machine-cleared; it says NOTHING about who clears a
 * `review:pending` one, and before #2844 nothing else did either. This CLI now REFUSES an `--to=accepted` verdict
 * whose clearing actor is provably the PR's own author (`we:scripts/lib/review-independence.mjs`), stamps the
 * clearing actor's id into the durable comment, and — when independence could not be established — says so in that
 * comment rather than leaving a silence a reader would misread as independence.
 *
 * `--to=clear-human` IS EXEMPT FROM THAT REFUSAL (PR #1100 review). The actor id is `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID` and a
 * SUBAGENT INHERITS ITS PARENT'S, so the comparison is SESSION-level and the operator's own `/review` ceremony —
 * which shells this CLI from inside the session that opened the PR — is a self-clear by that measure. Refusing the
 * human ceremony too made NOTHING clearable through the sanctioned path. The exemption is not a weakening: the
 * ceremony is refused unless the PR carries `review:human` and requires an explicit `--actor` plus a quoted
 * `--reason`, and the durable comment records that a HUMAN CEREMONY cleared it, never that an
 * established-independent agent did. THERE IS NO `--force` AND NO FLAG that lifts the `--to=accepted` refusal:
 * the two routes that clear a self-authored PR are the `clear-human` ceremony (on a `review:human` PR) and running
 * the review from a session that did not open the PR. The refusal message names exactly those two.
 *
 * INVARIANT 2 (the whole point): a `review:human` PR is NEVER cleared to `review:accepted` by anything but a
 * human's /review ceremony. `decideSetLabel` REFUSES `to==='accepted'` when the PR carries `review:human`
 * (`gate-self` is human-ceremony-only). The refusal lives in the PURE core so it is unbypassable — the CLI
 * cannot route around it. Do NOT weaken it. The `rearm` target carries the sibling #2630 invariant: an auto-fix
 * re-arms `review:changes → review:pending` but NEVER emits `review:accepted` and NEVER removes `review:human`.
 *
 * #2895 — INVARIANT 2 says who may NOT clear a gate-self PR; the `clear-human` target says how the one who MAY
 * actually does it. Before this, #2882 closed the raw label edit without opening a replacement, so the single
 * act the `review:human` tier exists to enable had no sanctioned way to perform it and the operator was pushed
 * to an unrecorded `gh` call — losing the `reviewed-sha` stamp and the attributed comment. `clear-human` is the
 * ONLY target that removes `review:human`, and `accepted` stays unconditionally refused on a `review:human` PR
 * — see `decideSetLabel` for why this is a target rather than a flag.
 *
 * WHAT THIS TARGET DOES NOT DO, stated up front so nobody re-derives it: it does NOT verify that a human ran
 * it. #2895 RULED that the unforgeable actor signal is DEFERRED — no local construct survives an agent with
 * shell access on the same machine (a flag is trivially passed; a local console's token is scrapeable; a tty
 * check is satisfied by `script`/`expect`). So this ships as the raw command with better manners, and the
 * manners are the point: the `reviewed-sha` stamp, an attributed comment, a stated reason, one documented path
 * instead of an ad-hoc paste. The mitigation that replaces the missing signal is the HONESTY TAX — `--actor`
 * and `--reason` are both REQUIRED, so misuse takes a lie rather than a silence, and every surface that reports
 * a clearance says what the record proves (the sanctioned path was followed) and not what it does not (that a
 * human followed it). The durable fix is #2946 (a hardware human-presence gesture), filed `someday`.
 *
 * Split mirrors `we:scripts/review-detail.mjs`: a PURE decider that takes the already-observed labels and
 * returns the swap, plus a thin impure CLI that does the `gh` calls and prints. REUSES
 * `we:scripts/lib/review-escalation.mjs` (`REVIEW_LABELS`, `hasReviewLabel`) — it never re-hardcodes the
 * label strings.

 *   • `rearm` — the #2630 invariant: ONLY a live `review:changes` is re-armable (idempotent — a second call
 *     refuses cleanly); the swap is ALWAYS `review:changes → review:pending`, NEVER `review:accepted`, and
 *     NEVER removes `review:human`. The strongest thing an auto-fix can do is re-arm the review, never clear it.
 *   • `clear-human` — the #2895 gate-self clearance: the ONLY target that removes `review:human` (and the only
 *     one refused when the PR does NOT carry it). Nothing here checks WHO is asking — see below.
 *   • `restamp` — the #x5e2ldj re-stamp: moves NO label at all. It exists because the drain's own
 *     content-preserving rebase moves the head, which makes the acceptance markers stale, which re-parks the
 *     very PR the drain was about to land — clear, rebase, re-park, forever. `review-escalation.mjs` names this
 *     fix in its POSITION section: the drain KNOWS it produced the rebase, so it can re-stamp rather than have

 *   `currentLabels` (the caller's OWN fresh read), so a `review:changes` verdict that landed after a caller's

  //
  // #2811 (web-everything/web-everything PR #2811) — WHY `review:accepted` IS ALSO RE-ARMABLE NOW. A `review:accepted`
  // verdict is a claim about a SPECIFIC head; it stops being true the moment a ci-heal or a mechanical rebase
  // moves the head without anyone re-reviewing it. Before this, nothing ever un-accepted a PR whose head moved
  // that way (`ci-heal-mark.mjs`'s own header used to say, correctly for the OTHER cases: "a CI-heal repairs
  // only the CI axis — it must NEVER touch review:*"). #2811 lived through the gap that leaves: the review
  // ran (legitimately, on the `owed-ci-rerun` parallel-dispatch path — see `reconcile-core.mjs`'s own docblock)
  // and accepted a head that a LATER ci-heal push then invalidated, and the visible `review:accepted` label
  // survived onto a commit the reviewer never saw. `classifyPr` (`we:scripts/progress-board.mjs`) reads
  // `review:accepted` as phase `queued` — nothing further owed — so a stale acceptance does not just mislead a
  // human, it stops the reconcile pass from ever re-dispatching a review for the new head at all.

  // before a merge, whatever the label says — `we:scripts/merge-ai-prs.mjs`'s own `decideReviewGate` comment:

 *      (`parseLatestHumanClearedSha` — bound to THAT ONE comment, never an older clearance a later plain accept
 *      could otherwise inherit; see that function's own docstring for why the binding matters), AND
 *   2. the content that clearance covered is PROVABLY unchanged at the new head — reusing
 *      `acceptanceCoversHead`'s existing diff/contribution-equivalence escape (#x169fqe/#x9xqexm) rather than
 *      trusting the caller's own "this was a content-preserving rebase" classification a second time. The SHA
 *      branch of that check never fires here (a restamp exists BECAUSE the head moved relative to the accepted

 *      now also gating the marker carry.
 *
 * FAILS CLOSED, like everything else `restamp` touches: a missing/unparseable fingerprint on either side falls

 * mistaken for a naming. The FIRST such naming across the findings wins, for a deterministic, single result even
 * when several findings each name one.

 * file's reviewer-verdict CLI and the conveyor `rearm-review.mjs` run this SAME observe→decide→write→re-read arc
 * against `gh`; only three things differ and they arrive as config (exactly the deltas #2644 names):
 *   • `defaultActor` — who the durable comment is attributed to;
 *   • `buildComment({ to, actor, decision }) => string` — the comment body;
 *   • `repoOptional` — when true a missing `--repo` is derived from the cwd repo (`gh repo view`; the fix agent
 *     runs inside its own lane clone, so cwd IS the PR's repo); when false `--repo` is required.
 * `fixedTo` pins the verdict (rearm) or, when null, the harness parses + validates `--to` (accepted/changes).
 * The printed payload shapes stay the caller's, via `successResult`/`refusalResult`. Impure (shells gh); the
 * PURE `decideSetLabel` above owns every invariant, so this harness only moves bytes.
 *
 * Fails closed on INPUT — every input is validated BEFORE any gh mutation. It does NOT promise atomicity, and
 * saying it did was false (#2964): the swap and the durable comment are two non-atomic `gh` calls, so a gh error
 * between them exits non-zero with ONE of the two already landed. What #2964 bought is that the half left behind
 * is the SAFE one to lose — comment first on a PR that is not yet accepted (an orphan marker is never read), swap
 * first on one that already is (an orphan marker there would freshen the #2409 gate's coverage for an acceptance
 * that never landed). See the ordering block in the body for the full argument; the seam is not sealed, only
 * pointed the safe way.
 *
 * `allowClearHuman` is the opt-in for the #2895 gate-self clearance. SAY WHAT IT ACTUALLY IS (PR #1056 review,
 * round 4 — the earlier wording over-claimed): it binds IMPORTERS ONLY, and today it binds nobody. This file's
 * own `IS_CLI` block passes `true` unconditionally, so EVERY shell caller of this CLI is opted in and the flag
 * constrains nothing on a command line. The one importer of this harness, `we:scripts/conveyor/rearm-review.mjs`,
 * pins `fixedTo: 'rearm'` and so could never reach `clear-human` by relaying an argv anyway; and nothing else
 * reaches the target at all — `we:scripts/lib/auto-land-seam.mjs#buildSetLabelArgs` builds a literal
 * `--to=accepted`. What the boolean buys is narrow and forward-looking: a FUTURE importer that forwards argv it
 * did not vet (the #2945 console is the next candidate) cannot land on `clear-human` unless it names the
 * capability in its own source, where a reviewer reads it. It is NOT a trust boundary and NOT a barrier — it is
 * an ordinary parameter of an exported function, so an importer that wants it just passes it. That is accepted,
 * because #2895 ruled the unforgeable signal deferred (file header); the mitigation is the honesty tax below,
 * not this boolean. It is deliberately a DUMB BOOLEAN rather than an injected predicate — a caller may declare a
 * capability, never supply a verdict (PR #1056 review, B2).

  // effect, on the stated grounds that "an orphan row in the merge authority is NOT inert, so it must never
  // precede the label it vouches for". That is right THERE, because from outside this process the operation
  // cannot see the five refusals above — its effect 1 shells this CLI, which may still refuse. It is right
  // HERE too, one layer down, because at this line those refusals have already happened. The two orderings
  // are the same rule ("never write the row while a refusal is still reachable") applied at two seams; the
  // operation's own sink is therefore a RECONCILER, not a second writer (see review-pr-io.mjs).

  // FAIL-SOFT ON THE LEDGER, DELIBERATELY — EXCEPT a CLEARING verdict whose git write missed (F4, below): a ledger

  //
  //   • NOT already accepted (the ordinary first accept, and every `changes` / `rearm` / `clear-human` bounce) —
  //     COMMENT FIRST. An orphan comment is INERT: `parseReviewedSha` is only ever reached behind a live
  //     `review:accepted` check (lazily, inside `if (hasReviewLabel(...accepted))` in `we:scripts/merge-ai-prs.mjs`,
  //     and again inside `decideReviewGate`'s accepted branch), so a marker with no label behind it is never read
  //     and the command stays re-runnable. An orphan LABEL is not inert: `review:accepted` with no marker makes
  //     `acceptanceCoversHead` fail OPEN, and the drain then merges with the #2409 staleness gate disarmed. Under
  //     the old edit-first order that was the reachable state — the exact hole this item was filed for.
  //
  //   • ALREADY accepted (the re-accept-after-a-fix flow: accepted at an older head, a commit rode in, the reviewer
  //     re-verdicts) — SWAP FIRST, the pre-#2964 order, deliberately kept HERE and only here. The swap degenerates
  //     to an idempotent `--add-label review:accepted`, so comment-first would post a marker naming the LIVE head
  //     while the acceptance is already live: `parseReviewedSha` takes the LATEST marker, `acceptanceCoversHead`
  //     flips to `covers: true`, and a run whose `gh pr edit` then FAILED would have FRESHENED the coverage of an
  //     acceptance it never applied — the drain lands a tree no successful swap vouched for. Swap-first keeps the
  //     marker on the swap side of that seam: a failed edit exits before the comment, the durable marker still
  //     names the OLD head, and the gate correctly re-parks. (Losing the comment after a successful swap here
  //     costs a RECORD, not the gate: the marker stays stale, which is the strict direction.)
  //
  // This is shape 1 from the item ("keep the marker on the swap side of the seam"), narrowed to the one case where
  // the marker is not inert. Shape 1 applied UNCONDITIONALLY — record first without the marker, swap, then stamp
  // the marker in a second comment — was rejected because it leaves the headline hole open: a failed marker post
  // after a successful swap is still `review:accepted` + no marker + fail-open. Shape 2 (refuse the run outright
  // when the PR is already accepted) was rejected because it removes the re-accept path the #2409 gate depends on
  // to un-stick a re-parked PR, and the item says that needs its own replacement.
  //
  // The test is keyed on the LABEL, not on `to`, on purpose: `buildComment` is caller-supplied, so this harness
  // cannot know whether a given importer's body stamps a marker. Assuming it might is the conservative direction.

  //       triple's trial history must keep accumulating past graduation or rule 6's computed demotion
  //       (platform-decisions.md#delegation-trial-record-graduation) can never fire — there would be no rows
  //       to compute it from. Dropped: logging no longer asks whether the triple is graduated at all.
  //
  //   (b) EVERY WRITE HARD-CODED `outcome:'landed', findings:null`, so a `review:changes` verdict — the
  //       independent review ACTUALLY finding a problem — was never written (the write only ever fired on
  //       `to === 'accepted'`). Fixed by ALSO firing on `to === 'changes'` on this channel, deriving
  //       `outcome`/`findings`/`informative` from the SAME `bounceEvidence` (#3334) the label decision itself
  //       was already made from — never a second, parallel read of the write-up. A `changes` round is logged
  //       `outcome: 'reworked'` (a confirmed miss — `we:scripts/lib/provider-routing.mjs#isCleanRecord` reads
  //       only `outcome`, so this alone is what makes demotion computable) with `informative: true` unless the
  //       write-up asserts a KNOWN zero finding count with no defect described. A clean `accepted` keeps the v1
  //       `outcome:'landed'/findings:null` shape — distinguishing a first-round clean accept from a
  //       reworked-then-landed one needs this PR's verdict-ledger.mjs history, still a separate follow-up.
  //
  //   (c) #3801 FORK 2: `self-fix`/`other` ARE NEVER PRODUCED BY ANY DISPATCH PATH. A PR's delegation marker
  //       can still carry either taskType (the marker's own vocabulary is unchanged here — out of this card's
  //       file scope), so this write path REFUSES to log a trial for one rather than silently producing the
  //       row Fork 2 forbids.
  //
  // THE DEDUP KEY IS NOW `(pr, outcome)`, NOT BARE `pr`. A single PR can legitimately carry MORE than one
  // session-delegation row — a `changes` round (outcome `reworked`), then a later `accepted` round on the
  // fixed head (outcome `landed`) — and each is a real, distinct trial that must be recorded; keying on `pr`
  // alone silently dropped every round after the first one ever written for that PR. Re-running the SAME
  // verdict for the SAME PR (a retry) still writes at most once, because it maps to the SAME outcome.

/**
 * we:scripts/review-set-label.mjs#buildVerdictComment — the reviewer-verdict comment body. PURE, so the one
 * place the `reviewed-sha` marker is attached to an accept is unit-testable.
 *
 * #2882 — `body` is the OPTIONAL caller-supplied write-up. The loop console records a one-line verdict and
 * passes nothing; `/review` (`we:skills-src/review/SKILL.md`) passes its full findings + verdict via
 * `--body-file`. Before this, the CLI could only emit the fixed one-liner, so `/review` hand-rolled
 * `gh pr edit` + `gh pr comment` to get a detailed comment — and thereby lost the marker AND bypassed
 * INVARIANT 2, which lives in `decideSetLabel` and only binds callers that come through here. Accepting a body
 * removes the reason to route around the single home.
 *
 * #2409 — on `accepted` the reviewed head SHA is stamped (`buildReviewedShaMarker`) so the drain can later
 * refuse to honour the acceptance if the head advanced past the reviewed tree.
 *
 * THE STAMP MUST WIN, AND THE READER DECIDES WHAT WINNING MEANS. `parseReviewedSha` is LAST-match-wins (it
 * scans every marker in a body and keeps the final one), so this builder does two things, belt and braces:
 *   1. it STRIPS any `reviewed-sha` marker out of the caller's body — a `/review` write-up legitimately quotes
 *      a prior round's marker while explaining why the head moved (#983's re-accept comment did exactly that),
 *      and a quoted marker must never be mistaken for this verdict's claim; and
 *   2. it appends its own marker LAST, so even a marker this strip failed to recognise cannot outrank it.
 * The first cut of #2882 put the marker FIRST and reasoned backwards about the reader — which silently
 * REGRESSED the pre-#2882 behaviour, because a quoted marker then overwrote the stamp. Caught in review on
 * PR #1005. The pin for this is a ROUND-TRIP assertion through the real `parseReviewedSha`, never a
 * string-position one: verifying producer and consumer independently is exactly how the inversion hid.
 *
 * The marker is omitted on `changes`, and when the head SHA is unavailable (`buildReviewedShaMarker` → '') the
 * gate fails open rather than reading a garbage marker.
 * #2844 — an acceptance also stamps WHO cleared it (`cleared-by-actor`, the harness session id — NOT the
 * free-text `--actor`, which is the point) and, when independence could NOT be established, says so in the
 * attribution. A clearance record that names only a self-declared actor is the "asserted but unenforced" state
 * this item exists to end; naming the id makes a later self-clear audit a machine read, not an archaeology.
 *
 * #2898 — THE CHANNEL IS AN INPUT, NOT A CONSTANT. This sentence used to end "via the Plateau Loop review
 * console" unconditionally, written when the module had exactly one caller. It now has four (the console, the
 * conveyor re-arm, `/review`, and since #3035 the declared `review-pr` operation), so the constant asserted a
 * provenance three of them did not come through. It was observed live on PR #1146: the operation's own footer
 * said *"Recorded through the declared `review-pr` operation (#3035)"* while this line, higher in the SAME
 * comment, credited the console. A durable record that states two provenances is worse than one that states
 * none — so a caller that supplies no `channel` now gets the NEUTRAL sentence (`Recorded by <actor>.`), never
 * another caller's identity. The caller knows the surface; it is told, and this renders what it is given.
 *
 * @param {{to:string, actor:string, headSha?:string, body?:string, reason?:string, reviewedDiff?:string,
 *   clearerId?:string, independence?:{independent:boolean,status:string,reason:string}|null,
 *   channel?:string, humanClearance?:{actor:string,sha:string}|null}} o -
 *   #x169fqe: `reviewedDiff` is the raw diff (or a precomputed fingerprint) the verdict was formed against.
 *   Omitted → no diff marker → the gate falls back to SHA identity, i.e. pre-#x169fqe behaviour.
 *   #2898: `channel` is the SURFACE the verdict came through, free text like `actor` (see `normalizeChannel`).
 *   #x9krtkb: `humanClearance` is ONLY meaningful on `to==='restamp'` — the caller's own proof (see
 *   `runReviewLabelCli`) that the acceptance being carried across this rebase was a `clear-human` ceremony AND
 *   that the reviewed content is unchanged at the new head. `null`/omitted renders a PLAIN restamp, exactly as
 *   before this field existed — a restamp of a plain agent accept must never mint a human clearance.

  // and whatever field the next caller needs. Everything BELOW it is the TRUSTED marker block, built only by
  // the validating `build*Marker` helpers. One sanitizer sits on the seam, so the guarantee is a property of
  // the SHAPE of this function rather than of a list of field names that has to be kept in sync.
  //
  // WHY NOT PER-FIELD. #2898 sanitized `--channel` and left `--actor` — its sibling, rendered by the very next
  // interpolation on the same line — reachable, and PR #1147's reviewer proved it: `--actor` alone forged a
  // `reviewed-sha` that `parseReviewedSha` read as gospel on a `changes` verdict (which appends no marker of
  // its own, so the forgery is the ONLY one in the body and last-match-wins hands it the win). Patching the
  // second field would have left the third. The per-input pattern re-opens on every new input by construction;
  // this does not.
  //
  // WHY SHAPE, NOT NAMES. The sanitizer neutralizes the HTML-comment SYNTAX, not a list of marker names. Every
  // MARKER this repo reads — `reviewed-sha`, `reviewed-diff`, `reviewed-contribution` (all three in
  // `we:scripts/lib/review-escalation.mjs`), the `cleared-human` MARKER (ditto), `cleared-by-actor` /
  // `authored-by-actor` (`we:scripts/lib/review-independence.mjs`), `drain-{park,skip,land}-reason`
  // (`we:scripts/merge-ai-prs.mjs`) — needs a literal `<!--` to open. Those parsers each hard-code their own
  // regex, so there is NO single list to derive a strip-set from; matching on the syntax is the only close that
  // covers a marker defined in a module this one does not import, or one invented after today.
  //
  // THE ONE PARSER THIS DOES NOT COVER, NAMED RATHER THAN LEFT IMPLICIT (#3060). `parseOperatorClearance`'s
  // OTHER regex, `CLEARED_HUMAN_PROSE_RE` in `we:scripts/lib/review-escalation.mjs`, is not marker-shaped — it
  // opens on the plain words "Cleared by … via `review-set-label.mjs --to=clear-human`", with no `<!--`
  // anywhere, so escaping HTML-comment delimiters gives it no purchase at all. A `body`/`reason` field shaped
  // like that sentence sailed straight through this boundary and parsed as a real clearance. It is closed
  // separately, by anchoring THAT regex to the start of the rendered body under the known `clear-human`
  // heading (a shape only this function's own preamble can produce, never a caller field, which is always
  // appended later) — see the note on `CLEARED_HUMAN_PROSE_RE` for the reasoning. Said again so it is not
  // missed: this render boundary is a complete answer for every `<!--`-opening marker, and an incomplete one for
  // prose-shaped parsers, which need their own per-parser argument.
  //
  // WHY ESCAPE RATHER THAN DELETE. `&lt;!--` renders as a visible `<!--` on GitHub, so a `/review` write-up
  // that legitimately QUOTES a prior round's marker still reads correctly (#983's re-accept comment did exactly
  // that) — it is simply inert to every parser, all of which scan the RAW body `gh pr view --json comments`
  // returns. Over-neutralizing is the safe direction: an escaped marker is text, an un-escaped one outranks the

 * IT NO LONGER STRIPS MARKERS, and that is the point (PR #1147 review). #2898 put a `reviewed-sha` strip here,
 * which made this function a SECOND home for a guarantee — and the first home never covered `--actor`, so the

 *
 * WHAT IT DOES: escapes the DELIMITERS — `<!--` → `&lt;!--`, `-->` → `--&gt;`. Nothing else is touched.
 *
 * WHY THAT IS SUFFICIENT for a marker parser, and how to falsify it. Every MARKER read anywhere in this repo is
 * matched by a regex that opens on a literal `<!--` (`REVIEWED_SHA_RE`, `REVIEWED_DIFF_RE`,
 * `REVIEWED_CONTRIBUTION_RE`, `CLEARED_HUMAN_RE` in `we:scripts/lib/review-escalation.mjs`; `actorMarkerRe` in
 * `we:scripts/lib/review-independence.mjs`; `drainReasonMarker` in `we:scripts/merge-ai-prs.mjs`). Remove every
 * literal `<!--` from a string and NONE of them can match it, whatever the marker is named, however the payload
 * is cased or spaced, and whether or not the marker was invented after this line was written. That is a
 * property of the marker SYNTAX, so it holds for markers this module cannot even see — which matters, because
 * those parsers each hard-code their own pattern and there is no shared registry to derive a strip-list from.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS NOT SUFFICIENT FOR (#3060, found FALSE against the code, not assumed true). Not every clearance
 * READER in this repo is marker-shaped: `parseOperatorClearance`'s prose fallback, `CLEARED_HUMAN_PROSE_RE`,
 * opens on the plain sentence "Cleared by … via `review-set-label.mjs --to=clear-human`" and contains no `<!--`
 * at all, so this escape gives it no purchase — a caller-supplied field shaped like that sentence sailed
 * straight through and parsed as a real clearance (`buildVerdictComment({to:'changes', body: thatSentence})`
 * against pre-#3060 code). It is closed at its own definition instead, by anchoring the regex to the exact
 * `clear-human` render shape rather than by widening what this function escapes — see the note beside
 * `CLEARED_HUMAN_PROSE_RE` in `we:scripts/lib/review-escalation.mjs`. Read "every marker" above as scoped to
 * marker-shaped parsers; it was never, and is not now, a claim about every parser this repo runs over a comment
 * body.
 *
 * WHY IT IS NOT A DELETE. `&lt;!--` renders as a literal `<!--` in GitHub-flavoured markdown, so a quoted
 * marker still SAYS what the write-up meant it to say; the parsers read the raw body, where it is inert. The
 * predecessor (`stripReviewedShaMarkers`) replaced one named marker with a backticked placeholder; this keeps
 * that readability property while covering every marker instead of one.
 *
 * ORDERING NOTE: `<!--` is escaped first, so the `--` it leaves behind cannot be re-consumed by the `-->` pass
 * (`&lt;!--` ends in `--`, and the closer pass needs `-->`).

 * the swap-first order of the day that left an ACCEPTED PR with no `reviewed-sha` marker; `acceptanceCoversHead`
 * fails OPEN on a missing marker, so it silently disarmed the staleness gate — exactly the partial state the
 * pre-flight exists to prevent. #2964 moved the comment ahead of the swap on a PR that is not already accepted,
 * so an under-count there now costs a failed run rather than a disarmed gate; on an ALREADY-accepted PR the swap
 * still goes first and the original consequence stands unchanged. `actor` and `reason` are argv and therefore

 * was actually passed rather than from a fixed-width placeholder that a long one would overrun. Over-estimating
 * is the safe direction: the cost is asking the operator to trim a body that would just barely have fitted.
 * #2844 — the projection is ALSO total over the independence outcomes, for the same reason it is total over the
 * targets: the `⚠️ Independence NOT established` note is extra chrome the earlier projection would have missed,
 * and under-counting it is precisely the 65,405–65,536 band failure M2 documents. Both unproven statuses render
 * a FIXED-length message (the proven `self-clear` never renders — the CLI refuses it before any write), so the
 * worst case is computed here from the real decider rather than guessed at with a placeholder width.
 * #2898 — `channel` joins them for the SAME reason: it is argv free text that lands in the rendered comment, so
