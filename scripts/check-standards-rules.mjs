 * check-standards-rules.mjs — pure, individually-testable rule bodies for the validator.

 * `check-standards.mjs` is a top-to-bottom live script (it loads the real registries and
 * `process.exit`s), which makes a new rule's correctness — false-positive safety especially — a
 * manual, un-regressed check. This module factors the highest-value, context-pure rules out of that
 * script so they can be unit-tested with synthetic fixtures (see `scripts/__tests__/`). The script
 * stays the single source of live behavior: it *imports and composes* these, so the test exercises
 * the exact code the production gate runs (backlog #251).
 *
 * Each rule takes already-loaded data + an item and returns `{ errors, warnings }`, where every entry
 * is `{ message, descriptor? }` — identical to what `check-standards.mjs` pushes — so the descriptor
 * feed (#095/#196/#197) and the human output are unchanged.

 * #3960 (multi-repo slice 4) — conveyor briefs that `cd` INTO an acquired lane clone and then invoke a WE tool
 * by a RELATIVE `node scripts/...` path are wrong the moment that lane's checkout is not WE's own: there is no
 * `scripts/` directory to find at that relative location, because the agent's cwd is the TARGET repo, not WE
 * (`we:reports/2026-09-23-conveyor-multi-repo-gap-map.md`, root cause 2 — "the tools' repo is the target repo").
 * The fix is to qualify every such call with an absolute WE root (`{{WE_ROOT}}` in the templates this repo
 * ships); this scan is what keeps that qualification from silently rotting back to a relative path.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS NOT EVERY `skills-src/conveyor/*.md`. `delivery-agent-brief.md` (and its v2, plus the
 * investigation/prepare-scope/prepare-decision briefs) also `cd "$LANE"` and then call WE tools by relative
 * path — but THEIR `$LANE` is acquired with no `--repo=` at all (`lane-pool.mjs acquire --lane=… --item=…`, no
 * repo flag), so it is always a WE lane by construction; a cross-locus build's SECOND, impl-repo lane is a
 * DIFFERENT variable acquired separately and never `cd`-relied-on for a WE tool call. `fix-agent-brief.md` /
 * `fix-agent-ci-brief.md` are different: `{{LANE_REF}}` is an EXISTING PR's head ref, which under multi-repo
 * fix/ci-heal dispatch (slice 5, not turned on by this item) can belong to any constellation repo — so THEIR
 * lane is the one that can silently stop being WE's own. {@link WE_ONLY_LANE_CONVEYOR_BRIEFS} names the briefs
 * exempt for that reason; anything NOT listed is checked by default, so a new conveyor brief earns the same
 * bug-closed default the rest of this file uses rather than needing to remember to opt in.

// ── Definition-of-green THRESHOLD registry (#2786) ─────────────────────────────────────────────
// check-standards.conformance.test.mjs proves no definition-of-green knob escapes
// check-standards.contract.json. The suite's two knob classes use two different discovery
// strategies, because they differ in kind:
//   • ENFORCEMENT flags are homogeneous (every one is a boolean), so the suite auto-discovers them
//     by `typeof export === 'boolean'` — a future flag is caught regardless of its name, closing
//     the #2786 gap where a `_ENFORCED`-suffix name heuristic would miss a flag named anything else.
//   • THRESHOLDS are heterogeneous (numbers, Sets, arrays, strings, a bound regex) — no runtime
//     predicate distinguishes a definition-of-green tuning knob from an unrelated exported constant
//     (this module exports many constants that are reference data, not a pass/fail boundary). So this
//     list is maintained BY HAND: every symbol here names a value a check compares a finding against
//     to decide a pass/fail (or error/warning) boundary — almost always a HARD-ERROR allowed-set/bound
//     with no accompanying warn-first flag (BACKLOG_KINDS-style, or the allowed-set companion of an
//     already-declared enforcement flag, e.g. MANDATE_FENCE_ALLOWED_PARAMS alongside
//     UNFENCED_MANDATE_ENFORCED). DIGEST_MAX_WORDS, LOCK_POINT_CODE_LINES_THRESHOLD,
//     LOCK_POINT_COLLISIONS_THRESHOLD and SCOPE_BASENAME_MAX_SUGGESTIONS are the warn-only exceptions
//     (an independent review caught the first attempt at this registry naming DIGEST_MAX_WORDS as "the
//     one" exception, which was itself false — these three are permanently-warn numeric budgets in
//     exactly the same shape, #2678/#3337), kept here because widening any of them still loosens a real
//     budget the contract governs, even though nothing downgrades an error to a warning for them.
//     Adding a new such knob to the engine means adding its symbol HERE *and* its value to the
//     contract's `thresholds` — two independent declarations that must agree (checked by the
//     conformance suite), so a silent widening of either turns the suite red.
// RESIDUAL GAP (accepted, not closed by either strategy): a boolean or bound INLINED at its call site
// — never a named export — is invisible to both discovery strategies. Only a named export can be
// governed this way; that is the boundary of what a coverage guard over `import * as rules` can see.

//     but each is an array of ARROW-FUNCTION predicates — not JSON-representable, so neither this
//     registry's string-symbol list nor the contract's JSON `value` field can hold them.
//   • COMPOSE_DENY_LIST is the allowed-set companion of the already-declared COMPOSE_TRAITS_ENFORCED
//     flag (same shape as MANDATE_FENCE_ALLOWED_PARAMS/UNFENCED_MANDATE_ENFORCED above) but each rule
//     embeds a `signature` array of REGEXES inside an object — also not representable as one JSON
//     `value` the conformance suite's `sameValue` can compare, so pinning it here would either need a

// explicit carve-out." #2089 filed this rule as the enforcement follow-up (#2131) precisely because the
// obligation to ADD the edge at scaffold time was statute-enforced judgment, not script-enforced — this
// turns the last mile from reviewer recall into a deterministic gate, per the hookable-vs-judgment rule.
//
// Predicate is TAG-KEYED and DECLARED, not auto-derived (declared-over-auto-derived): the author opts an
// item into the gate with the `polyglot-widening` tag. A blanket match on the broad `polyglot` tag would
// false-positive on the ~38 polyglot-tagged decisions/maintenance/consume items — the whole point of the
// predicate (#2089: "by predicate, not item list") is that it names *new target/form* work only, which
// the author asserts by tagging.
//

// PROSE — a buried fork, an author "not batchable as one; re-slice" note, an "external infra" / "agent
// cannot provision" deliverable, a "blocked-in-fact" / "open question" caveat. When that prose is
// present but the flags still compute `batchable`, the loader over-reports agent-readiness and every
// batch pre-flight re-rejects the item by hand instead of fixing the data (the recurring slip this
// lint kills — see memory `feedback_misflagged_batchable_fix_real_state`).
//
// The caller restricts this to `item.batchable === true`, so the lint SELF-CLEARS the moment the real
// state is encoded: retyping to `decision`, bumping `size` to ≥13, parking, or adding the real
// `blockedBy` edge all drop the item out of `batchable`, and the warning vanishes with no further
// edit. The only items it fires on are exactly those still computed-batchable while their body says
// otherwise. WARNING, not error: prose heuristics aren't proof, and the fix is a deliberate re-flag.
//

// ── Derived advisory tier cross-check — the domain→project evidence join (#2135, #2088 Fork 3) ──
// A WARN-ONLY cross-check demoted from #2088 Fork 3 (c): flag an `exploratory` project whose DOMAIN
// shows benchmark demand — a signal its tier may be understated. It is *advisory only*: it NEVER owns
// or computes the `tier` value (that stays the stamped, named-consumer judgment of Fork 3 (a),
// validateProjectTier above) — a divergence is a nudge to a human, not a gate failure.
//
// Why a DECLARED join, not a derived one: #2088 Fork 3 rejected deriving the tier because "no domain→
// project join exists at all — projects carry no intents/blocks lists, intents/blocks carry no project
// field, only protocols have ownedByProject; the association is prose-only." The one structured edge
// (protocol.ownedByProject → protocol.realizesIntent → intent.requiresCapabilities) does NOT reach the
// benchmark-demand signal: requiresCapabilities is keyed by web-platform PRIMITIVE ids (`popover`,
// `contenteditable`), while benchmark demand is keyed by component-CAPABILITY ids (`combobox`, `tabs`)
// — a different namespace. So the domain→demand edge is genuinely absent from the data and cannot be
// auto-derived soundly. This builds it as an EXPLICIT DECLARED mapping instead (declared > fragile
// auto-derivation): `benchmarkCoverage.projectDomainDemand[]` — each row NAMES the project, the benchmark
// capability whose demand its domain covers, and a one-line evidence cite. The check joins that declared
// edge to the live `tier` stamp and warns only on the (project=exploratory ∧ declared-demand) cross.
//
// On today's real data this warns ZERO: benchmark demand is all component-level UI surface, while every
// `exploratory` project is an infra/protocol domain (webinjectors, webregistries, webrealtime, …) with
// no benchmark-capability demand to declare — so `projectDomainDemand` is legitimately empty of firing
// rows. The mechanism (the join + the advisory) exists and is unit-exercised with synthetic rows; it
// stays quiet until a future sweep declares a real domain→demand edge for an exploratory project.

/**
 * #3383 mechanical-dispatcher fix — live #3565 trial (2026-09-13). Every DISTINCT unmarked pathlike token
 * {@link scanRepoLocusPrefixes} would flag in ONE document's content, deduped — the shape an auto-fixer
 * needs (which exact substrings to prefix) rather than a count + first sample. Reuses
 * `scanUnmarkedLocusRefs`'s identical scan (the SAME `PATHLIKE_RE`/`LOCUS_MARKER_RE`/exemption checks the
 * gate itself runs), so a fixer built on this can never drift from what the gate actually flags.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS: `we:scripts/operations/deliver-item-wrapper.mjs#sanitizeOwnLocusMentions` (added by
 * #3565's wrapper-owned-commit redesign) used to prefix bare mentions of ONLY the delivery's own touched
 * paths, on the assumption that a delivery agent's backlog prose only ever quotes files IT just touched.
 * A live #3565 dispatch trial disproved that: the pre-commit `lint:locus` hook still rejected the
 * wrapper's own commit (`locus-prefix: 2 bare code-path ref(s) ...`) because the agent's own `## Progress`
 * note also cited an UNTOUCHED existing file bare (`queue-store.mjs`, mentioned for context, never itself
 * part of the diff) — a token the touched-paths-only fixer had no way to know needed prefixing, since it
 * was never in that list to begin with. Scanning the file's own FULL content with the real detector,
 * instead of a caller-supplied guess at which tokens might appear, closes that gap by construction: it
 * prefixes everything the gate would flag, whether or not it happens to be one of the delivery's own
 * touched files.

// PR #1803 committed a literal <system-reminder> block into a backlog item — copy-pasted from the
// authoring agent's own context, not an external attack, undetected until human review. A real leak
// always lands as its OWN block: the tag opens a fresh line, and a `Claude-Session:` header likewise
// starts its own line — so those two markers are anchored at line-start (optional leading
// whitespace, or a `>` blockquote prefix — a leak pasted into review discussion is often quoted) rather
// than matched anywhere in the line. That is what lets this rule pass on backlog/report content that
// merely *describes* the incident in prose (e.g. this very item's body mentions "<system-reminder>" and
// "SendUserFile" mid-sentence, never at a line's start) while still catching a genuinely pasted block.
// SCOPE NOTE: this is a "leaked BLOCK" detector, not a "leaked marker anywhere" detector — a marker
// smashed into the middle of a sentence (not opening its own line) is intentionally out of scope, the
// same tradeoff #1803's own shape (a genuine multi-line paste) makes safe. `SendUserFile`'s tell is
// different — the harness phrases it as a natural-language instruction ("… send it with SendUserFile")
// rather than a line-opening tag, so its marker matches that phrase anywhere in the line.

// as ratified or built — a decision ratified inline per-fork ("ratified at operator review, <date>") with
// no status flip, or a build story carrying a "Verified done, <date>" blockquote (the convention this
// session introduced while fixing #3838–#3849) whose status was never resolved. A batch pass re-selected
// several of these as "ready to build" though they were already done — real wasted effort, and it
// depended on a human/agent noticing by luck. This is the standing mechanical check for it.
//
// WARN, never ERROR: this is a heuristic over prose, and a body may legitimately DISCUSS "ratified"
// without asserting that THIS card is done — most commonly by citing ANOTHER item's ratified anchor
// ("Ruled in #3801 Fork 2", "ratified #2089 Fork 1(b)"). Calibrated against the real corpus: a bare
// "ratified"/"Ratified" match is FAR too broad (1000+ backlog files mention it, almost all citing some
// other anchor), so the markers below require a DATED, EMPHASIZED (bold/italic) assertion or the specific
// blockquote convention — and even then, a matched span naming a `#NNNN` reference is treated as citing
// that OTHER item's ratification and dropped (this alone cleared 3 of 7 raw hits found calibrating against
// the current corpus — #1137, #2821, #3374 — each citing a different item's ratification date, not its
// own).
//
// Scoped to `open`/`active` — a `resolved` item is definitionally not stale in this sense (#3383's own
// framing) — and skips `kind: epic`: an epic's own "## Ratified …" heading routinely documents a ratified
// DESIGN for its children's build, not completion of the umbrella itself (verified against two real open
// epics with exactly that shape, #2612 and #2804 — both carry a dated "## Ratified …" heading for how their
// children should be built, while the epic itself correctly stays open pending those children). A `kind:
// decision` whose forks are ratified inline is the readiest true-positive case (#3801) but is still only a

// The WE repo intermingles two surfaces (#2006): WE-the-standard (the zero-impl authority — the
// intent/block/plug/protocol/semantic defs, meta-schemas, conformance gate, backlog) and the WE-website
// render (an artifact-producing 11ty+Vite product, mis-homed here, end-state extraction gated on #872).
// #2006 Fork 2(b) ratified a *directory boundary* whose interim carrier is this fail-closed classifier:
// every path in the RENDER-TREE ZONE (`src/**` — where the two surfaces interleave, plus the build
// configs that only exist to render the site) must classify as EXACTLY ONE of {standard, site}. A path
// in that zone matching NEITHER prefix set is a HARD ERROR, so new site code can never masquerade as
// standard (nor a new standard def hide among the loaders).
//
// Scope is deliberately the render-tree zone, NOT literally every tracked path: node_modules/, backlog/,
// tools/, tests/, the impl trees, etc. are neither standard nor site — classifying them would be noise
// and would red-gate the whole repo. The zone is exactly the interleave surface #2006 names, where a new
// file's classification is load-bearing for the eventual `site/**` lift (Fork 1a). Everything outside the
// zone is `neutral` (unclassified-and-that-is-correct) and is not policed here.
//
// site-surface  = the render/product: page templates, layouts, render partials (incl *-descriptions/),
//                 assets, css, render fixtures, AND the src/_data/*.{js,ts} Eleventy loaders.
// standard-surface = the definitions the standard owns: the src/_data/*/  per-entity .json registries and
//                 the src/_data/*.json top-level data files (the assembler-loader seam scripts/lib/*-loader.cjs
//                 that BOTH the gate and the site loaders consume stays WE with the gate — it is standard).
// A path under the zone that is neither (e.g. a new `src/foo.tsx` or a `src/_data/newLoader.mjs`) errors —
// the author must place it on the correct side of the seam (a .njk/.js render file is site; a .json def is
// standard) so the boundary stays machine-legible ahead of the physical `site/**` lift.

 * TWO NUMBERED CARDS CLAIMING THE SAME BIRTH. Under JIT numbering (#2288) an item is born with a hash and the
 * drain mints its NNN at land, recording the hash as `bornAs`. That hash is the item's IDENTITY across the
 * rename, so two cards carrying the same one are the same item minted twice.
 *
 * WHY EVERY EXISTING CHECK MISSES IT, which is why this is its own rule rather than a branch of one:
 *   · `duplicateBacklogNums` compares `num`. The twins have DIFFERENT numbers — that is what makes them twins
 *     rather than a collision — so it sees nothing.
 *   · `strandedHashesOnMain` looks for a hash still in the FILENAME. Both twins are properly numbered; the
 *     duplication lives in the frontmatter, which that rule never reads.
 * The one state nothing looked for is the one that actually happened.
 *
 * HOW IT HAPPENS, from the live case this was written for. A stale hash-named copy of an already-landed card
 * sat in a lane's working tree; a `git add -A` swept it into an unrelated commit; the drain, doing its job,
 * minted it a fresh NNN. Result: `#3201` resolved and `#3244` OPEN, same `bornAs`, byte-identical bodies — a
 * card describing finished work back in the ready pool, where selection would hand it to someone to redo.
 * PR #1506's juror caught that exact file one commit before it minted and said it "would have minted a
 * duplicate bornAs". It later did.
 *
 * ERRORS ONLY WHEN A TWIN IS UNRESOLVED, because that is the case with a live cost. Two RESOLVED twins are an
 * audit-trail smudge and warn instead — this tree carries such a pair (#3111/#3112) predating the rule, and
 * erroring on it would redden main over a defect with no consequence, which is how a gate gets ignored.

/**
 * #2319 — hash-on-main invariant. Under JIT numbering (#2288) a new item is born with a provisional hash id
 * (`xNNNNNN`) and the drain mints its real NNN AT LAND (`numberPendingHashes`). So a `backlog/<id>-*.md` on
 * `origin/main` whose leading id is NON-numeric means a land route bypassed numbering (e.g. `pr-land
 * --fallback-git`'s local-merge degrade, per #2322) and stranded a hash. This is DISTINCT from the duplicate-NNN
 * detector (`duplicateBacklogNums`, #2248/#2291): a LONE unique hash is not a collision, so that check misses it
 * entirely. Pure + unit-tested — takes the `backlog/*.md` paths present ON MAIN (a git ls-tree, so in-lane
 * pre-land hashes that live only on a `lane/*` branch never false-trip). Fix a fire with
 * `node scripts/backlog.mjs number-stranded`.
 *
 * #2956 — the drain's OWN in-flight numbering window is not a strand. `pr-land` pushes the merge commit,
 * then the drain pushes the JIT-numbering commit SEPARATELY, 7-73s later (measured across real lands — see
 * the card). A checkout fast-forwarded onto the merge commit inside that window legitimately sees a
 * hash-led file that the drain is already about to fix, and the OLD hard error's remedy
 * (`number-stranded`) is an out-of-lane mutation that races the drain's own numbering if run there.
 * Detection: for each candidate file, look at the epoch of the LAST commit that touched it on
 * `origin/main` (`commitTimeFor`, supplied by the caller via `git log -1 --first-parent --format=%ct` — the
 * `--first-parent` is load-bearing: without it, pathspec history simplification walks past a `--no-ff`
 * merge into the lane's own commit and returns ITS timestamp, not the merge's, #2956 r1). A file touched
 * within `graceWindowSeconds` of now is presumed in-flight — downgraded to a WARNING that does not name
 * `number-stranded` (running it here would race the drain) — rather than a hard error. A file older than
 * the grace window is a genuine strand: the drain's window has long since closed, so the fix is safe to
 * run, and it still hard-errors with the remedy intact. The grace window (`STRANDED_HASH_GRACE_SECONDS`,
 * default 180s) is set comfortably above the measured 7-73s trailing gap so the false-positive window is
 * covered without materially delaying detection of a real strand (a re-run minutes later still catches
 * one). When `commitTimeFor` can't produce a timestamp for a path (unknown git error), the file is treated
 * as NOT in-flight — i.e. it still errors — so a signal failure fails toward the old, safe-but-noisy
 * behaviour rather than silently swallowing a real strand.
 * @param {string[]} mainBacklogPaths  `backlog/<id>-slug.md` paths tracked on origin/main
 * @param {object} [opts]
 * @param {(path: string) => number|null} [opts.commitTimeFor]  epoch seconds of the last commit that
 *   touched `path` on origin/main, or `null` if unknown. Defaults to "unknown" for every path (so callers

 * @param {() => number} [opts.now]  epoch seconds "now" — injectable for deterministic tests.

// has tested whether crafted caller text actually changes an agent's verdict, and the degree of influence is
// UNMEASURED. Do not read (or write) a wider claim than "caller-supplied text reaches the mandate unfenced".
//
// CODE ONLY, NEVER PROSE (PR #1235 review, blocker 1). Everything below reads the builder body through
// `maskNonCode` — comments, string/template TEXT and regex bodies are blanked before anything is matched. The
// unmasked r0 scanned raw source, so `// TODO: fenceUntrusted('goal', goal) later` next to a raw `${goal}`
// SILENCED the error (the fence "call" was a comment), and, in the other direction, a docblock that merely
// SHOWS `${goal}` in an example flagged a builder that never splices it. A gate a comment can switch off is
// not a gate; a gate this repo's commenting style reddens is not one either.

// TWO LIMITS, both deliberate and both worth knowing before trusting a green run:
//   1. It is a DEFINITION-level scan. `fenced` is opt-in on some builders (`buildEditorMandate`), so a builder
//      that merely OFFERS a fenced path passes — the rule does not verify that each CALL SITE opts in. Call-site
//      verification is a different scan over a different file set; this one does not do it.
//   2. It sees only a parameter interpolated DIRECTLY (`${goal}`, `${String(goal).trim()}`), and counts it
//      fenced only when the param name appears in `fenceUntrusted`'s SECOND argument — the data expression. The
//      TAG (first argument) is masked with the rest of the string literals on purpose: `fenceUntrusted('goal',
//      somethingElse)` must not exempt a raw `${goal}` elsewhere in the body. So a param first copied into a
//      local (`const g = goal;`) is invisible when spliced (no taint tracking, by design) and reads as UNfenced
//      when only the local is passed to the fence. In the other direction it is deliberately blunt: a param
//      merely MENTIONED inside an interpolated expression (`${goal ? a : b}`, where only its truthiness is
//      read) counts as interpolated. Over-flagging costs one allow-list line; under-flagging costs the finding,
//      so both bluntnesses point the safe way.

// `scope:` is machine-read: `scripts/readiness/dispatch-plan.mjs` matches it by EXACT path through
// `coversFile`, so an entry naming a path that does not exist covers nothing — the file the work really
// touches goes undeclared, and two items that are really the same-file collision look disjoint to the
// dispatcher. That is the failure this catches: `we:scripts/lib/__tests__/lane-verify.test.mjs` when the
// tracked file is `we:scripts/__tests__/lane-verify.test.mjs` (#3321), or `we:scripts/lib/foo.mjs` when the
// module lives at `we:scripts/foo.mjs`. 8 of the `scripts/lib/*.mjs` modules keep their test at the
// top-level `scripts/__tests__/` rather than a sibling `scripts/lib/__tests__/`, so the wrong directory is
// the natural guess for any of them.
//
// WARNING, NEVER AN ERROR — the greenfield case is legitimate. A scope may name a file the item is about to
// CREATE (#3307's `we:scripts/lib/claim-sweep.mjs` was correct as written), and static state cannot tell a
// to-be-created file from a typo. What CAN be told apart is the SHAPE: a basename that matches nothing
// anywhere is a genuine new file (silent); a basename that already exists at a different path is the shape
// that is provably a typo far more often than not. Erroring would redden exactly the greenfield case.
//
// FALSE POSITIVES ARE THE FAILURE MODE (the gate already emits ~1400 warnings — noise makes the whole pile
// less read, not more), so the rule is deliberately narrow on four axes:
//   1. LOCAL REPO ONLY. Only `we:` entries are checked. `fui:`/`plateau:` paths live in sibling repos this
//      gate cannot see, and "not found" there would mean "not checkable", not "wrong".
//   2. FILE ENTRIES ONLY. A subtree entry (glob / trailing slash / extensionless — `isSubtreeEntry`) leases a
//      tree, never an exact path, so "does it resolve" is not even the right question for it. The dir-level
//      shape is already the separate #2739 finding.
//   3. BEST-TAIL SUGGESTION, NOT EVERY BASENAME MATCH. Candidates are ranked by how many TRAILING path
//      segments they share with the entry, and only the top tier is offered. This is what makes a generic
//      basename safe: `.claude/skills/review/SKILL.md` has 27 `SKILL.md` matches, but exactly one shares the
//      `review/SKILL.md` tail — so the warning names one probable path instead of a useless list of 27.
//   4. A WIDE TOP TIER IS SILENCE. When even the best tier is bigger than SCOPE_BASENAME_MAX_SUGGESTIONS the
//      basename is generic AND undiscriminating; there is no path to suggest, the evidence is weak, and an
//      unactionable "this looks wrong" is exactly the warning that trains people to skip the output.
// Resolved items are skipped and a non-empty `scopeRationale:` clears the finding — the same two escapes the
// dir-level rule above uses, so an author whose odd-looking entry is deliberate has one place to say so.

// created `~/.claude/commands` and populated the operator's user-global config, live in every unrelated repo
// they open, without ever asking.
//
// WHY A HOOK IS THE PLACE TO GATE IT, and not "anywhere the flag appears": a hook runs on every merge, on
// every clone, unattended, with nobody reading its output. The same flag typed by hand is a choice; typed
// into a hook it is applied silently and repeatedly to whoever cloned the repo. It was caught by a reviewer,
// which is exactly the kind of catch that does not repeat.
//
// A PROMPT, NOT A WALL (`GITHOOK_ALL_ALLOW`). A hook that genuinely needs the flag says so on the line or the
// one above it. A rule you can only obey is a rule people suppress wholesale; one you can answer gets read.

 *   · `=` — so `--all=1` survives as one word for `isAllFlagWord`'s prefix arm. It costs `VAR=--all` reading

 *   · round 1 accepted only whitespace / `=` / end-of-line as a terminator, so `… --all;` was missed — in a

// ── Leash pin (#2892 — enforces #2840 trigger 3, guards #2838's flip-edit safeguard) ───────────────
// The declarative-leash files — the review-policy contract (which owns `careJury.disposition.landMode`, the
// shadow→enforce switch), the roster, the invariant / conformance suites — are human-gated AS WHOLE FILES,
// permanently (`#human-is-principle-surface-not-path`, trigger 3): they ARE the encoded principle, so no edit to
// one is behaviour-preserving. #2838's whole safety story leans on that floor ("the flip edit is itself
// `review:human`"): if the contract could quietly leave the human gate, the single most oversight-reducing edit
// in the system would become agent-clearable. This rule is the standing assertion that it has not.
//
// TWO INDEPENDENT ANGLES, so a regression has to fool both:
//   1. CLASSIFICATION — every pinned basename is still in `POLICY_SPEC_BASENAMES` (the roster still calls it a
//      declarative-leash file). Catches a `leash: 'code'` reclassification or a dropped roster entry.
//   2. BEHAVIOUR — the REAL rubric (`scoreEscalation`, injected as `isHumanGated`) still returns
//      `humanRequired` for a diff that touches the file, whether the file's own hunks are a whitespace-only touch
//      (a hunk the STATUTE term would exempt, so only the path floor can hold it) or were NOT COMPUTED at all.
//      Catches the composition itself (`isPrincipleSurface` / the rubric's term) losing the unconditional path
//      floor while the roster still looks right — the case a roster-only check cannot see.
// A third, cheap check keeps the pin from going VACUOUS: a pinned entry whose registered `homes` no longer exist
// on disk is a renamed/deleted file the roster still "protects" — the pin then guards nothing.
//
// FAIL DIRECTION. All findings are hard ERRORS (there is no warn-first flag: on the current tree none fires, and
// each names a change that reduces human oversight). The one WARNING is growth: a leash file the roster gained
// that this snapshot does not yet name — its later removal would go unpinned.
//
// The snapshot is EVERY `POLICY_SPEC_BASENAMES` member as of this rule. It is a snapshot on purpose, not derived
// from the roster: a derived pin would shrink in lockstep with the thing it guards. Read it as a SECOND KEY, not a
// lock: this file is engine-tier (an edit escalates to the committee), so removing a name here is not by itself
// human-gated. What makes dropping a leash file a human decision is that it cannot be done WITHOUT a human-gated
// edit — the roster lives in `gate-config.mjs` (a declarative-leash file), the unconditional path floor in its
// `isPrincipleSurface` (marked), and the rubric's `humanRequired` derivation in `review-escalation.mjs` (marked).
// This rule is what turns a slip in any of them — a typo'd `leash:` value, a floor made conditional, a renamed
