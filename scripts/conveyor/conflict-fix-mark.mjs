/**
 * @file scripts/conveyor/conflict-fix-mark.mjs
 * @description Post the durable conflict-fix comment for a STACKED-BASE mechanical rebase (#3383), with NO label
 *   swap of any kind. The stacked-base sibling of `we:scripts/conveyor/advisory-fix-mark.mjs`, with the SAME
 *   deliberate shape: a durable marker comment, no label touched.
 *
 * WHY NO LABEL SWAP. `we:scripts/conveyor/reconcile-core.mjs`'s STACKED-BASE CONFLICT branch dispatches this
 * repair straight from the `conflicted` phase — the PR was NEVER bounced to `review:changes` first (unlike the
 * ordinary main-base conflict-fix round `we:scripts/conveyor/rearm-review.mjs --round=conflict` hands back), so
 * there is nothing to "re-arm". `review:accepted` (or whatever the PR already carried) rides through this repair
 * completely untouched — the point of the whole branch: a stacked PR's conflict against its OWN base, caused by
 * a fixer pushing to that base, is a purely mechanical rebase, never a reviewer-facing content conflict that
 * would owe a fresh human verdict. This file NEVER touches `review:accepted`, `review:changes`, `review:human`,
 * `review:pending`, or any other label — only the durable comment below.
 *
 * WHY THE SAME MARKER AS THE ORDINARY CONFLICT-FIX ROUND. `we:scripts/conveyor/conflict-fix-round-count.mjs`'s
 * {@link CONFLICT_FIX_COMMENT_MARKER} (and its {@link countConflictFixComments} reader) are single-sourced and
 * REUSED here unchanged, deliberately, rather than a fourth bespoke marker — this is the IDENTICAL kind of round
 * (a mechanical rebase-and-resolve, never a judgment call over a reviewer's finding) `#xkmu3gv` (PR #2579) built
 * `CONFLICT_FIX_ROUND_CAP`/`countConflictFixComments` for, just posted by a different caller for a population
 * that never goes through `rearm-review.mjs`'s label swap. Sharing the marker means BOTH populations bind on the
 * SAME durable cap `reconcile-core.mjs` reads back off the PR's own comment thread — no third counter to drift
 * from the other two.
 *
 * WHY A DURABLE COMMENT AT ALL (mirrors #2643/#2666/#xkmu3gv). `reconcile-core.mjs` bounds this population's
 * auto-fix at `CONFLICT_FIX_ROUND_CAP` so a genuinely unresolvable stacked-base conflict cannot flap forever;
 * that cap must survive a conveyor RESTART, which wipes any in-session tally. Each completed round posts exactly
 * ONE comment whose leading line is {@link CONFLICT_FIX_COMMENT_MARKER}, and the count IS PR state, read back off
 * the PR itself — no parallel state store (#2612 invariant).
