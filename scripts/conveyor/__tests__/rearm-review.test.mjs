/**
 * @file scripts/conveyor/__tests__/rearm-review.test.mjs
 * @description Pins the PURE re-arm decision for the conveyor fix agent (WE #2630). `decideRearm` swaps a
 *   repaired `review:changes` bounce back to `review:pending` for re-review — and enforces the #2630 invariant
 *   in the pure core (unbypassable): it NEVER emits `review:accepted` and NEVER removes `review:human`. So the
 *   strongest thing an auto-fix can do is re-arm the review, never clear it. Also pins idempotency (a PR with
 *   no `review:changes` refuses) and the `presentRemoveLabels` narrowing.
