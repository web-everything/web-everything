/**
 * @file scripts/conveyor/tick-core.mjs
 * @description The MECHANIZED CONVEYOR TICK CORE (WE #2699, epic #2677(a)). ONE pure function
 *   ({@link planTick}) that turns a tick's read-only inputs — the {@link ../readiness/conveyor-state.mjs
 *   conveyor-state} read, the {@link ../readiness/dispatch-plan.mjs dispatch plan}, the free-lane ids, and the
 *   conveyor's in-session guard/watcher bookkeeping — into the tick's MECHANICAL decisions (which agents to
 *   spawn, which watchers to arm, which guards to retire, whether to idle-stop, and the status line) PLUS the
 *   next bookkeeping state. It mechanizes the deterministic per-tick orchestration the /conveyor SKILL
 *   (we:skills-src/conveyor/SKILL.md §2–3) previously re-derived in prose: chain state-read → dispatch-plan,
 *   filter launches through the in-flight / prepare / fix guards, arm watchers, retire guards on
 *   claim / return / TTL / PR-terminal / re-dispatch-gate, and idle-stop. The SKILL now only EXECUTES the
 *   returned decisions (spawn the agents, arm the watchers, post the line) and carries `nextState` into the next
 *   tick — it never re-derives a guard rule in prose.
 *
 *   Scripted per [we:docs/agent/platform-decisions.md#deterministic-core-thin-judgment] (#2607): every
 *   script-decidable rule of the tick — the three guards and their retirement, watcher arming, idle-stop — is a
 *   deterministic, tested core; the JUDGMENT the SKILL keeps (the readiness discussion, supervising a build,
 *   reviewing an escalation, ratifying a decision) stays out of here. Same inputs → same plan, always.
 *
 * PURE-CORE / IO-SHELL SPLIT (the hard design constraint, mirrored from dispatch-plan.mjs + conveyor-state.mjs):
 *   • The PURE core ({@link planTick} and every helper above the shell banner) has NO fs / git / `Date` /
 *     child_process / gh — the state read, the plan, the free lanes, the bookkeeping, and the clock (`now`) are
 *     all passed IN. It is unit-tested directly (scripts/conveyor/__tests__/tick-core.test.mjs) with plain
 *     objects, no git/network. Two imports, both pure: `normNum` from {@link ./queue-store.mjs} — the SAME id
 *     normalizer the state read and dispatcher key on, so this core can never disagree with them on item
 *     identity — and {@link ../lib/lane-concurrency.mjs} — the SAME concurrency-ceiling helper
 *     `dispatch-plan.mjs` uses for its own build launches (#xupukxa), so the two lane-consuming decisions this
 *     core makes (prepare/fix/ci-heal spawns) share one budget with dispatch-plan's builds rather than each
 *     independently maxing out the free-lane pool.
 *   • The IO SHELL (the `main()` CLI, gated on the main-module check) gathers the read-only inputs by shelling
 *     the existing readiness scripts — `conveyor-state.mjs --json`, `dispatch-plan.mjs --json`, and
 *     `lane-pool.mjs list --acquirable --json` for the free lanes — reads the conveyor's bookkeeping from STDIN
 *     (it is SESSION-EPHEMERAL process state, never a committed repo store — memory rule 105 / SKILL §5), calls
 *     the pure core, and emits `{ decisions, nextState }`. The SKILL pipes its current bookkeeping in and carries
 *     the emitted `nextState` to the next tick IN-SESSION — no parallel on-disk state store is ever created.
 *
 * THE THREE GUARDS — mechanized here EXACTLY as the SKILL documents them (their semantics are UNCHANGED; this
 * only moves the derivation from prose to a tested core):
 *
 *   1. IN-FLIGHT DISPATCH GUARD (build). One `{ num, lane, spawnedTick }` entry per spawned delivery agent.
 *      {@link filterLaunches} drops a `plan.launch` entry whose `num` OR whose assigned `lane` matches a LIVE
 *      guard entry — the contended resource is the LANE, not just the item, so BOTH must exclude (else tick N
 *      launches {num,lane}, the agent is slow to acquire, and tick N+1 re-assigns that lane to a different
 *      top-of-queue num while agent A is still starting — two agents on one lane). {@link retireBuildGuards}
 *      retires an entry three ways: CLAIMED (its lane shows leased in `state.lanes` OR the item left
 *      `state.queue`), AGENT-RETURNED (an injected `signals.returnedBuildNums` — the Agent completed/errored),
 *      or TTL (still pending after `buildTtlTicks`, default 3 — the required backstop for an agent that died
 *      after spawn but before claiming; surfaced as a note the first time).
 *
 *   2. PREPARE GUARD (scope + decision) — DIFFERENT bookkeeping, do NOT copy the build guard's retirement. One
 *      `{ num, kind, lane, spawnedTick, sawPr }` entry per prepare-scope / prepare-decision agent, keyed by
 *      `num` (the contended resource is the item's SCOPE/FORK authorship, not the incidental lane). A prepare
 *      NEVER claims and leaves the queue only at MERGE (several ticks), and its Agent RETURNS at PR-open, well
 *      before merge — so the build guard's "retire on Agent-return" rule would be a double-dispatch bug here.
 *      {@link retirePrepareGuards} therefore retires ONLY on: SCOPE-COMMITTED (the item left the pending set —
 *      `state.unshaped` for a scope prepare, or the un-prepared `state.decisions` rows for a decision prepare),
 *      PR-TERMINAL (a prepare PR was seen open and has now left the open set), or TTL-TO-FIRST-PR
 *      (`prepareTtlTicks`, default 5 — fires ONLY while NO open PR for the num has ever appeared, to catch an
 *      agent that died pre-PR; once an open prepare PR exists the TTL is VOID). NEVER on mere Agent-return.
 *      The re-dispatch gate ({@link planPrepareSpawns}) is the UNION: skip spawning a prepare for `num` when
 *      EITHER a live prepare-guard entry exists for it OR `state.prs` has an OPEN PR for that `num` (which,
 *      while the item is still unscoped/un-prepared, can only be its prepare — the backstop if the guard is lost).
 *
 *   3. FIX GUARD (§3c) — TWO separate pieces of state. An in-flight ENTRY `{ pr, num, lane, spawnedTick }` keyed
 *      by PR number ("a fix agent for this PR is live now"), and a per-PR attempt counter `fixAttempts[pr]`
 *      ("how many auto-fixes this PR has cost in total") that SURVIVES entry retirement and clears ONLY when the
 *      PR is terminal. Keeping the counter off the entry is the whole point: a bounce → fix → re-arm → bounce
 *      AGAIN is a NEW `review:changes` with no live entry, so a counter on the entry would reset each cycle and
 *      the cap would never bind. {@link planFixSpawns} skips a PR with a live entry (in-flight test), stops at
 *      the retry cap (`fixRetryCap`, default 3 — surfaced for `/review`), else spawns and records a new,
 *      UNCLAIMED entry — it does NOT bump the counter (#3454). The entry additionally tracks a sticky `claimed`
 *      flag: {@link retireFixGuards} flips it true the tick its assigned lane is observed LEASED in `state.lanes`
 *      (the same fact {@link retireBuildGuards} uses for the build guard's CLAIMED path) — that is the moment a
 *      PLANNED candidate becomes a CONFIRMED real attempt (dispatch-lane.mjs got past its own in-flight guard and
 *      actually started the agent), and only THEN does {@link planTick} bump `fixAttempts[pr]`, once, off
 *      `retireFixGuards`'s `newlyClaimed` list. A dispatch `dispatch-lane.mjs` refuses pre-flight (a stale
 *      `claude agents` liveness entry, say) never leases its lane, so it is never counted — its entry TTLs out
 *      UNCLAIMED (`reason: 'ttl-unclaimed'`) and is retried for free, mirroring the build guard's own "never
 *      claimed after N ticks" backstop. {@link retireFixGuards} retires the ENTRY when the PR no longer carries
 *      `review:changes` (re-armed / terminal) or on TTL (`fixTtlTicks`, default 5, split `ttl` claimed vs.
 *      `ttl-unclaimed`) — NOT the counter, which {@link clearTerminalFixAttempts} drops only when the PR leaves
 *      the open set. Because `fixAttempts` is in-session process state, it does NOT survive a conveyor restart;
 *      the cap therefore also reads a DURABLE floor `prRearmCounts[pr]` derived from the PR's own re-arm comments
 *      (`countRearmComments` — one comment per completed auto-fix, #2643), and binds on `max(in-session,
 *      durable)`. The durable floor is the restart-surviving source of truth (no parallel state store, #2612 —
 *      the count IS PR state); the in-session tally is the overlay that additionally counts a CLAIMED fix agent
 *      that died before re-arming (which leaves no comment for the floor to see).
 *
 *   3b. CI-HEAL GUARD (§3c-ci, #2666) — the SIBLING of the fix guard, SAME entry+counter+cap+TTL shape, but its
 *      trigger is a CI REGRESSION not a `review:changes` label: a conveyor PR that was GREEN AT OPEN
 *      (`ready-to-merge` / a review park) but has since gone RED on a required check ({@link isRedCi}) or BEHIND +
 *      parked ({@link isBehind} — the not-landable BEHIND case #2183 leaves unhealed). The delivery agent has long
 *      exited and the drain skips a red-CI PR, so nothing heals it. {@link planCiHealSpawns} dispatches a CI-heal
 *      agent that rebases + repairs ONLY the CI half and NEVER touches the review label. Its cap binds on
 *      `max(in-session ciHealAttempts, durable prCiHealCounts)` — the durable floor from the PR's own CI-heal
 *      comments (`countCiHealComments`, #2666 mirrors #2643), so a restart never resets a burned PR.
 *      {@link retireCiHealGuards} retires the ENTRY on CI recovery / PR-terminal (`resolved`) or TTL; the counter
 *      clears ONLY on PR-terminal ({@link clearTerminalCiHealAttempts}). `review:changes` PRs are EXCLUDED — the
 *      fix loop (guard 3) already rebases them.
 *
 * WATCHER ARMING (§4): {@link armWatchers} arms one watcher per OPEN PR whose `num` this conveyor DISPATCHED
 *   this session (`launchedNums` — builds AND prepares) that is not already watched, and prunes the watched set
 *   to the currently-open conveyor PRs (a merged/closed PR's watcher already exited). Scoping to conveyor-launched
 *   nums keeps an unrelated PR's stray `review:*` label from waking the loop. Each armed entry carries the
 *   `releaseSession` slug ({@link releaseSessionForNum}) the watcher passes as `--release-session`, so on MERGE
 *   pr-watch auto-releases that item's lane lease(s) across pools — the ghost-lease reclamation #2667 built and
 *   #2700 wires in (the periodic lease-reaper, SKILL §4c, is the catch-all backstop for what auto-release misses).
 *
 * HEALTH / STALL BACKSTOP (§2): `state.health` is now LIVE — #2616 populates the lane→num map on
 *   `acquire --item`, so `conveyor-state`'s stall scan flags a genuinely silent lane rather than always reading
 *   `ok`. {@link planTick} CONSUMES that verdict as a real backstop: `buildStatusLine` shows the `⚠ lane-N` warn
 *   and each stalled lane becomes an actionable `lane-stalled` note, so the per-tick lease-reaper reclaims the
 *   stalled lease and the operator sees it. It never auto-re-dispatches a guard on a stall (the 3-min threshold is
 *   far below a guard's spawn-to-death TTL — the guard TTLs remain the re-dispatch backstop, un-regressed).
 *
 * IDLE-STOP (§6): {@link assessIdleStop} stops ONLY when the queue is empty (no cleared `buildQueued` rows, no
 *   in-flight lanes, no open conveyor PRs) AND there has been no operator feedback for `idleWindowMs` (default
 *   15 min). It reads the operator-feedback clock (`now`, `lastOperatorTurn`) as injected inputs and deliberately
 *   IGNORES `state.idle.lastQueueAdd` (that field is the drain's queue, not the conveyor queue — SKILL §6).
 *
 * HELD-REASON NOTES (§7, telemetry-gap fix): the IO shell already shells `dispatch-plan.mjs` for `plan` (it needs
 *   `plan.launch`) — its `plan.held` (every queued-and-cleared item's `{ num, reason }`, the SAME reasoning a
 *   human previously had to run `dispatch-plan.mjs --json` BY HAND to see) was computed every tick but silently
 *   dropped: `planTick` only ever read `plan.launch`. A tick could show real spare capacity and
 *   `spawnBuilds: []` for many consecutive ticks — correct behavior (every held item really was scope-blocked or
 *   not-ready) — with NOTHING in the tick's own output explaining why. This loop surfaces each held item as its
 *   OWN note (mirroring the `needs-slice` / `decision-ready` / `lane-stalled` notes above: a continuous,
 *   re-derived-every-tick fact about backlog state, not a one-shot event — the codebase's existing discipline for
 *   "this is still true" signals, as opposed to the build/prepare/fix guards' one-shot TTL-retirement notes). It
 *   SKIPS `needs-slice` / `needs-decision` / `unshaped-no-scope` — each of those held reasons already has its OWN
 *   dedicated note above (from `state.needsSlice` / `state.decisions` / the prepare-spawn notes respectively) — so
 *   no item is ever double-reported under two note kinds. What is left — `overlaps lane-<n>`, `no free lane`,
 *   `cleared-but-not-ready`, and (defense-in-depth; unreachable via the production shell per dispatch-plan.mjs)
 *   `blocked` — had NO other surface at all before this.
 *
 * LOAD ADMISSION (#4076, revised #4343) — a SECOND admission axis, ORTHOGONAL to `config.maxConcurrentLanes`
 *   (#xupukxa, above): that ceiling is a fixed, hardware-blind lane COUNT; this gate reads the host-sampler's
 *   actual CPU idle% + memory pressure (via the IO shell's `loadAdmission` input, resolved by
 *   `../readiness/heavy-admission.mjs#resolveLoadAdmission` — this pure core never touches fs itself) and
 *   withholds EVERY new dispatched-session launch this tick — builds AND the free-lane pool prepare/fix/ci-heal
 *   spawns draw from — when the host reads as genuinely saturated (idle% low, or memory pressure elevated, or a
 *   much-higher-ratio `load1/cores` runaway backstop), beside whatever the fixed ceiling separately admits.
 *   Surfaced as `load-cap` notes (distinct from `capacity-cap` — the fix differs: wait for load to drop vs.
 *   raise the cap / free a lane). Already-running lanes/guards/watchers are untouched, mirroring
 *   `dispatchPaused`'s own posture. See `loadCapReading` and the `loadHeld` branches in `planTick` for the
 *   mechanism.

 * `prCiHealCounts`, #2643/#2666): read a fact from the GROUND TRUTH each tick — here, whether the OS session
 * the dispatch spawned is still alive — rather than trusting only the in-process TTL countdown. Pure: given the
 * live-session ROWS (the IO shell's one `claude agents --json` read, {@link defaultListAgents} in
 * `../operations/dispatch-lane-io.mjs`), extract every num with a live BUILD session. A session merely being
 * LISTED counts as durable-live regardless of `state` ambiguity (unlike `reconcile-core.mjs`'s liveness

 * guards against is a double-dispatch, so erring toward "still guarded" a little longer than strictly necessary
 * is the safe direction.

 * an optimization. This function's ORIGINAL reasoning ("once the OS session actually exits, `claude agents
 * --json` stops listing it and this floor clears on its own") was found FALSE the same night a live audit
 * turned up 26 registry rows — `conveyor-*` among them — still listed 6-13.5 DAYS after their process died,
 * `state` never advancing. Before this exception, ANY listed `conveyor-<num>` name durable-guarded that num
 * forever, however long the listing itself was stale — permanently suppressing a REAL re-dispatch of an item
 * whose only "in-flight" evidence was a phantom registry row, silently (the status line's own display already
 * ages a never-claimed durable entry out of its COUNT after `buildTtlTicks` — see `countableBuildGuards` at
 * this function's call site — but that never touched the guard itself, which kept blocking dispatch under the
 * cover of a status line that had stopped mentioning it at all). A row carrying an explicit `pidAlive === false`
 * — the SAME two-signal probe `driver-watchdog.mjs#resolvePidAlive`/`scanPsOutput` established and
 * `lease-reaper.mjs`/`session-reaper.mjs` already reuse (a row's own `pid` when present, else a `ps aux` scan
 * for its full `sessionId`) — is a CONFIRMED death, not an absence of evidence: nothing double-dispatches
 * against a session that provably no longer exists, so excluding it here costs none of the protection this
 * floor exists for. `true` (genuinely alive) and `undefined`/`null` (unknown — no `pidAlive` resolved at all,
 * the exact shape every pre-#3383 caller/test still passes) both keep the ORIGINAL "list alone is enough"

/**
 * PLAN the fix-agent spawns for `review:changes` bounces (SKILL §3c). For every OPEN `state.prs` row that this
 * conveyor launched (`num` ∈ `launchedNums`) and carries `review:changes`: skip if a live fix-guard ENTRY
 * already exists for the PR (the in-flight test); else if the PR has reached the retry cap surface it for
 * `/review` (no spawn); else spawn a fix agent on a free lane and record a new, UNCLAIMED entry.
 *
 * DOES NOT BUMP THE ATTEMPT COUNTER (fixed #3454 — was the phantom-attempt bug: PR #1861 hit "auto-fix
 * exhausted" after exactly TWO real spawns and zero commits, because the old code bumped `fixAttempts[pr]` the
 * instant a spawn was PLANNED here, before `we:scripts/operations/dispatch-lane.mjs` ever ran. That downstream
 * call is a SEPARATE step outside this pure core (this runner only surfaces `decisions.spawnFixes` — it "spawns
 * no LLM agents itself", `we:skills-src/conveyor/runner.mjs`), and it owns its OWN in-flight guard (a stale
 * `claude agents` liveness entry can make it refuse with `dispatching:false` before a lane is ever acquired).
 * Refused-pre-flight ≠ a real attempt, but the old code could not tell the difference — it counted every
 * SURFACED candidate, whether or not dispatch-lane ever got past its own guard. The counter now only bumps once
 * a REAL attempt is CONFIRMED — {@link retireFixGuards}'s claim detection, the SAME `state.lanes`-leased fact
 * {@link retireBuildGuards} already uses for the build guard's CLAIMED retirement. A dispatch refused pre-flight
 * never leases its assigned lane, so its guard entry TTLs out UNCLAIMED (`reason: 'ttl-unclaimed'`) and is
 * retried for free next tick — mirroring the build guard's own "never claimed after N ticks — re-dispatching"
 * TTL backstop, which never burns anything either.
 *
 * The cap is checked against `max(in-session fixAttempts[pr], durable prRearmCounts[pr])` (#2643). The in-session
 * `fixAttempts` map does NOT survive a conveyor restart, so on a fresh conveyor it starts empty and the cap would
 * never bind — the very unbounded fix↔bounce loop the cap exists to prevent. `prRearmCounts` is the DURABLE floor
 * derived from the PR's own re-arm comments (`countRearmComments`, one per completed auto-fix): it restores the
 * count after a restart, and the in-session map stays as the within-session overlay that also counts a fix agent
 * that DIED AFTER CLAIMING but before re-arming (which posts no comment, so the durable floor can't see it — that
 * TTL-backstop case still terminates at the human via the in-session tally, bumped at claim time by the caller —
 * see {@link retireFixGuards}'s `newlyClaimed`). Pure — returns the spawns, new (unclaimed) entries, the
 * (unchanged, pass-through) counter map, consumed lanes, and the surface notes; mutates no input.

 *   • building — distinct nums that are an in-flight build guard OR an active (non-prepare) leased lane. The
 *     guard half covers only the brief spawn→claim window (the build guard retires at claim), so the leased-lane
 *     half carries the count through the actual build — which needs `state.lanes[].num` populated from the
 *     lane-ports registry (#2616 populates it on `acquire --item`). Where that map is empty the count reflects
 *     only the spawn→claim window (a known undercount, not a miscount — no tick decision reads this line).
 *   • preparing — distinct live prepare-guard nums (scope + decision).
 *   • fixing — live fix-guard entries.
 *   • healing — live CI-heal-guard entries (conveyor PRs gone red/BEHIND after open, #2666).
 *   • queued — cleared `buildQueued` rows NOT already in flight (building/preparing).
 *   • parked — distinct conveyor-launched OPEN PRs carrying any `review:*` label.
 *   • health — `state.health.verdict`; a `warn` appends the flagged lanes.
 *   • infra — `state.infraBlocked` count (only when non-empty).
 *
 * `building` HERE IS NOT `dispatch.builds.length` IN `.conveyor/driver-status.json` — an intentional, DIFFERENT
 * number, not a bug (a live report on 2026-09-14 read the two together as inconsistent — worth naming here so
 * the next reader doesn't re-diagnose the same non-bug). `building` is this tick's TOTAL currently-in-flight
 * build count (guards + leased lanes, carried forward across ticks); `surface.dispatch.builds` (`decisionsOut.
 * spawnBuilds`, `runner.mjs#tickSurface`) is only the builds THIS tick freshly spawned — routinely 0 while
 * `building` stays > 0, whenever nothing new needed dispatching but earlier builds are still running. What WAS
 * a real bug, fixed alongside this comment (#3383 follow-up, see `durableBuildNums`): a phantom `claude agents`
 * registry row (listed, `pid: null`, its real process long dead) used to inflate `building` right along with a
 * genuinely live one, since the durable-floor read below had no way to tell them apart. It now excludes any row
 * a real `ps aux`-backed liveness probe confirms dead, so `building` (and this line) reflect only sessions
 * nothing has disproven — never a stale registry artifact.
