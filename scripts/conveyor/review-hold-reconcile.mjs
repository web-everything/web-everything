 * @description THE REVIEW-HOLD RECONCILE SWEEP (#x01u7az) — a one-time-and-ongoing cleanup pass for two
 *   contradictory/stray label states `we:scripts/review-set-label.mjs#decideSetLabel` now refuses to produce
 *   GOING FORWARD, but which already exist on open PRs from BEFORE the fix landed. A forward fix alone never
 *   touches a label that is already wrong; per the operator's own standing rule ("we always take failure as an
 *   opportunity to improve our product, never as a problem that needs manual intervention"), the cleanup is a
 *   mechanical pass, not a hand-run `gh pr edit`.
 *
 * TWO INDEPENDENT INVARIANTS, ONE SWEEP (they were both live on web-everything/web-everything on 2026-09-24, and both
 * are "a review:* label describing a state that no longer holds"):
 *
 *   1. AT MOST ONE review:* HOLD LABEL. `review:human` is itself a hold — a gate-self PR needs no `review:pending`
 *      on top of it to say "an independent review is owed"; the human hold already says that. Before this sweep's
 *      companion fix (`decideSetLabel`'s `rearm` branch), a mechanical re-arm of a `review:human` bounce added
 *      `review:pending` unconditionally, live on PR #2549 (`review:pending` added 2026-09-24T14:05:09Z by
 *      `we:scripts/conveyor/rearm-review.mjs`, on top of `review:human` set 01:32:17Z and never cleared — still
 *      both live on that PR as of this sweep's authoring). `planReviewHoldCleanup` drops the stray `review:pending`.
 *   2. `advisory:*` ONLY MEANS SOMETHING ON A `review:human` PR (`we:scripts/lib/advisory-labels.mjs`'s own
 *      header). Before this sweep's companion fix (`decideSetLabel`'s `clear-human` branch), clearing the human
 *      gate left a stamped `advisory:accepted`/`advisory:changes` behind with no `review:human` left for it to
 *      describe — live on PR #2578 (`advisory:accepted` stamped 13:29:54Z while `review:human`, `review:human`
 *      cleared 13:38:11Z, the advisory label never removed). `planReviewHoldCleanup` drops it.
 *
 * A THIRD, HEALED — NOT MERELY DROPPED (#2766/#2767, 2026-09-26). `review:accepted` + `review:human` co-present
 * is not a stray LEFTOVER a blind label removal can safely clean up — `decideParkToHuman`'s own write-time fix
 * (`we:scripts/lib/review-escalation.mjs`) stops FUTURE occurrences, but an already-contradictory PR needs its
 * COMMENT HISTORY read first: #x9xqexm forbids an automated pass from ever deleting a GENUINE, currently-valid
 * human clearance, and a label-only read cannot tell one from a bare, superseded agent accept. So this sweep
 * fetches comments ONLY for a PR that already carries the pair (cheap — never a list-wide hop), and:
 *   - a genuine clearance of the LIVE head (`parseLatestHumanClearedSha` matches) → FLAG only, same as before;
 *   - no such clearance (the confirmed #2766/#2767 shape) → HEAL: `review:accepted` comes off, `review:human`
 *     stays, a durable comment explains why (`decideContradictoryVerdictHeal`/`buildContradictoryVerdictHealComment`).
 *   - the fetch itself fails → FLAG only (fail closed toward NEVER deleting on unproven data).
 *
 * NOT A DUPLICATE of `we:scripts/conveyor/advisory-label-sweep.mjs` — that sweep drops an advisory label whose
 * REVIEWED HEAD has gone stale (the PR moved past what the advisory looked at); this one drops an advisory label
 * whose REVIEW:HUMAN GATE has gone stale (the PR is no longer gate-self at all, so no head comparison is even
 * meaningful). Both are real, disjoint conditions the SAME `advisory:*` pair can go stale under, and a PR could in
 * principle need either — running both mechanical passes on every tick (as `we:skills-src/conveyor/runner.mjs`
 * already does for the sibling sweep) is what makes them agree without a shared special case in either file.
 *
 * PURE-CORE / IO-SHELL, mirroring `advisory-label-sweep.mjs`'s own split: {@link planReviewHoldCleanup} takes
 * only a PR's `labels` and is fully unit-testable with no `gh`; {@link sweepReviewHoldLabels} is the IO shell,
 * with the PR list and the label provider injectable so the whole pass is testable without a real `gh` call too.
 *
 * WHAT IT NEVER DOES: add a label (the heal path's own `decideParkToHuman` decision never needs to — `human`
 * is ALREADY live on every PR this sweep heals, by construction of the pair it heals), or touch anything but
 * the removals named above. It never removes `review:human` itself (that is `clear-human`'s job, a deliberate
 * human/independent-agent act, never a sweep's), and it never adds `review:pending`/`review:changes` — a stray
 * label is dropped, never replaced with a guess at what it should have said instead.
